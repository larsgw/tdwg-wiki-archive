---+!! Welcome to the home of the <strong>Biological Descriptions WIKI</strong>

*NEWS:* The former SDD_ TDWG subgroup has renamed itself and is now the "Biological Descriptions" Interest group. As a result, the SDD_ wiki will be demoted to a taskgroup wiki soon.

This is a web-based collaboration area for discussions of the subgroup on the Structure of Descriptive Data of the [[http://www.tdwg.org][Taxonomic Data Working Group]]. We welcome your contributions - please see the bottom of this page if you are new to this Wiki.

---+++Starter Topics

   * *NEW:* [[SDD_.RealWorldExamples_SDD1dot1]]


   * [[SDD_.Version1dot1][Version 1.1]] was released on 20 Mar 2007; discussion at SDD_.DiscussionFor1dot1. It is recommended that all usage of SDD_ should refer to this version rather than to the older 1.0.
   * [[SDD_.ServicesUsingSDD_][Services or programs using SDD_]]
   * [[SDD_.HistoryAndContext][History and context of SDD_]]
   * SDD_ development is now supported by a [[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/SDD_/Primer/SDD_][Primer]]. The primer is based on version 1.1 RC 1; the few minor technical corrections of the release relative to this release candidate should in general not affect the primer. Please inform us if you detect any problems with the primer.

   * After the changes to the constitution and the new [[http://www.tdwg.org/about-tdwg/process/][Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) process]] we need to submit a new charter for both an Interest Group and a Task Group.
      * QUESTION: should the name remain SDD_, or should it be changed to Structured Descriptive Data and Identification (SDDI)?
      * [[InterestGroupMain.BDI.Charter][Biological Descriptions Interest Group SDD_.Charter]]
      * SDD_ SchemaTaskGroupMain.BDI.Charter
      * Who is interested in incremental markup of taxonomic treatments in digitized legacy systematics literature, that goes into the detail like SDD_? TaxonX is so far largely complementary to SDD_. Anybody wants to form a new task group?
      * Note: The previous SDD_.Charter revisions are still available in the history of [[SDD_.Charter]]

   * The SDD_ group is considering defining a subset of the current SDD_ Schema, "SDD_ Lite" with the goal of producing a representation of the main concerns of SDD_. &#8220;SDD_ Lite&#8221; would try to use the RDF/OWL technology currently preferred by some other groups of TDWG and intended to be TDWG's new common development architecture. Hence, the SDD_ Interest Group especially seeks people interested, and with suitable experience in, the use of Semantic Web technologies for describing taxa. THIS may require setting up a new task group. Who is interested in this?

   * SDD_.WhatToDoWithElementsMarkedForDiscussion: "double underbar elements" are only for discussion, all will be removed when finalizing!

   * Topic name conventions: topics renamed to <strong><nop>ResolvedTopic...</strong> or <strong><nop>ClosedTopic...</strong> are still valuable to read, but old and not relevant to ongoing discussions. Topics renamed to <strong><nop>ZZZObsolete</strong> are resolved or closed topics that I consider no longer intelligable based on the current version of the schema.
