It is unclear how one could define (in <nop>StatisticalMeasures) ),  or give a value to ( in a Character in a Description) a multivariate statistic such as a covariance matrix.

Surely a covariance matrix is a product of an analysis of descriptive data, rather than descriptive data itself. Can this be left for SDD2020?

I agree with Kevin. I have never seen any actual demand for storing it or using it as a mean to communication and archive information. Covariance matrices are used in analyses based on the most recent data and will by nature span several characters, i.e. can not be defined within a character.

Bob, you have an example, or was this a purely theoretical comment?

However, I don't mind changing <nop>StatisticalMeasures to <nop>UnivariateStatisticalMeasures to clarify. Is that desirable?

In 0.91 it will be <nop>UnivariateStatisticalMeasures.
