It seems that if A, B, and C are Statements on the children of a node, it is always logically correct to make the Question on the parent be "Does one of A, B, or C describe the object?". So the point is to provide the author with a more rational question than this? -- Main.BobMorris - 17 Nov 2003

This was my idea, I think. In Lucid Phoenix, we found that it's nice to be able to offer people both the conventional statement type of key, and a (perhaps) more user-friendly question-answer style. A conventional statement key is the one we're all familiar with as taxonomists, e.g.

<verbatim>
1  Leaves ovate........2
1a Leaves elliptic.....3

2  Flowers blue.......etc
2a Flowers red........etc
</verbatim>

These keys are maximally efficient for printing on paper, but of course we're way past Gutenberg here. 

A question-answer style key is very nice I think for computer representations for naive users, e.g.

<verbatim>
1. What shape are the leaves?
    a) ovate............goto 2
    b) elliptic.........goto 3

2. What colour are the flowers?
    ...etc
</verbatim>

These are particularly good when the "leads" e.g. ovate and elliptic are images. That's why it's nice to have both question text and lead text (or images).

I agree. BDI.SDD_ allows to add specific image resources intended as icon (Representation/MediaObject role="iconic") or "selector images" (Representation/MediaObject role="diagnostic"). Icons can supplement text, selectors can replace text (= Representation/Label). Question/Label is of this label type, similar to character and state labels. BDI.SDD_ thus supports:

<pre>(no question)
  text statement (with optional icon)
  text statement (with optional icon)

(no question)
  Selector image<br />
  Selector image

Question text
  Selector image
  Selector image

Question text
  text statement (with optional icon)
  text statement (with optional icon)
</pre>
