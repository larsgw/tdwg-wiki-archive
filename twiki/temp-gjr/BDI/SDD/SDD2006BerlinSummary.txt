---+TDWG BDI.SDD_ Technical Review Meeting

<strong>3-7. April 2006<br/>
Federal Biological Research Center for Agriculture and Forestry, Berlin, Germany</strong>

---++1. Goals

The goal was to resolve outstanding technical and substantial issues resulting from implementations of the UBIF and BDI.SDD_ Schema version 1.0 finalized at the previous TDWG meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia. The motivation for the changes were to achieve a solid foundation for an improved primer and technical documentation. Earlier documentation created for intermediate versions is now obsolete.
---++2. Participants

   * Bob Morris, 
   * Gregor Hagedorn
   * Jacob Asiedu
   * Damian Barnier (not Friday)
   * Kevin Thiele (not Friday)
   * Markus Döring (only Tuesday)

---++3. Outcomes

The technical issues (especially schema validation under different software implementation) were resolved on the first day. The core problem was the relationship between descriptive concepts, characters, and character or concept hierarchizations. The (recurring) underlying problem is that BDI.SDD_ has to satisfy both operational and fundamental concepts. While the intention was to release a minor revision ("BDI.SDD_ 1.01"), the outcome after the agreed changes was called [[Version1dot1][BDI.SDD_ version 1.1]].

The meeting drafted the BDI.SDD_ [Charter] as recommended by the TDWG TIP and Process groups, discussed and revised the [[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/viewfile/TAG/TagMeeting1Report?filename=BDI.SDD_-TAG1.ppt][BDI.SDD_ presentation]] requested by Roger Hyam for the TAG meeting in Edinburgh (BDI.SDD_ participant: G. Hagedorn).

---++4. Outlook

Although initial implementations of BDI.SDD_ 1.0 were already carried out, wider implementation attempts were hampered by the lack of sufficient documentation and examples. Implementations of BDI.SDD_ 1.1 are agreed for Lucid and the EFG guides, and it is hoped that further groups find the resources to implement BDI.SDD_. The next meeting called "BDI.SDD_ lite" will try to address this by bringing potential implementers together and defining a subset of BDI.SDD_ containing those concepts most urgently needed by these groups. The BDI.SDD_ Lite meeting will also review and update the primer and techncial documentation, and may result in an explicit "profile" of BDI.SDD_ with a reduced complexity.
