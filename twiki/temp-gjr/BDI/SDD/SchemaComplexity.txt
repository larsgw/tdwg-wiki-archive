Complex schemas may look overwhelming (see for example the XML Schema Schema at http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.xsd) but the fact is, complex schema-based applications can now have their infrastructure written by software. For Java, the Sun Java Databinding API, JAXB, systems like the Castor databinding system, http://www.exolab.org and the "Generate Code" command on XML Spy's DTD/Schema menu will generate all the marshalling and unmarshalling code given the Schema. (The latter two also can generate C++). These frameworks are all you need to convert between objects in the programming language and those in your schema. In particular, if you have an XML Schema for your own descriptive data, the only programing task you will have to emit or consume BDI.SDD_ is to write glue in the programming languge of your choice (if supported by the databinding framework you choose) between the two kinds of data (yours and SDDs). You never need to write anything that produces or consumes XML. That's the job of the framework.
