---++Synopsis

This document attempts to verbally describe how DELTA data sets may be converted for use by BDI.SDD_ compatible applications. First the conversion of the DELTA core directives is fully discussed, next a list of advanced DELTA directives is presented with annotations as to whether or how they can be evaluated in BDI.SDD_.

*This document is currently incomplete and frequently refers to an outdated version, it needs revision!*

See also <a href="SDD_DELTA_CompSections.html">"Comparison of sections and subsections with DELTA features"</a> for a useful overview and the general [[DELTAandBDI.SDD][overview of DELTA related material]].

---++Files to import

Some DELTA compatible applications store all terminological and descriptive data in a single file (Pankey, optionally DeltaAccess). However, CSIRO DELTA (the most widely used DELTA application) uses multiple files. The core files are SPECS, CHARS, and ITEMS. In addition, valuable information is often found in the CNOTES, CIMAGES, KIMAGES, TIMAGES, TOINT, TOKEY, and TONAT files. Some files are created for specific purposes (TOINT = translation into the CSIRO IntKey binary format, TOKEY = creation of printable keys, and TONAT = creation of natural language descriptions) and use the remaining files through an include file mechanism. As a result, the information in CSIRO DELTA files may be overlapping. For example, both TOINT and TOKEY may define different character reliability or include/exclude character directives.

In general the TOINT file (if present) is a good starting point to resolve all DELTA include commands ("*Input File") and import the data. A better strategy is, however, to also look for further include files and directives in other files (esp. TOKEY and TONAT) and add any new directives to the BDI.SDD_ conversion process. Thus, the directives in TOINT (and files referenced therein) have priority over possibly differing information in TOKEY and TONAT.

Note: since CSIRO DELTA usually uses fixed file names, the BDI.SDD_ project name can either be obtained from the (rarely used) *Heading or *Registration Heading directives (see <a href="#AdvancedConversion">Advanced conversion concepts</a> further below), or the name of the folder containing these files can be used.


---++Simple export

This sections deals primarily with the task of exporting the most basic <a href="SDD_DELTA_Directives.html">DELTA directives</a>, <b>*Character List</b> (= <b>*Character Descriptions</b>), <b>*Character Types</b> and <b>*Item Descriptions</b> into an BDI.SDD_ document. These directives are relatively complex and map to a number of BDI.SDD_ data elements. Less detailed information about additional DELTA directives can be found in the next chapter <a href="#AdvancedConversion">"Advanced conversion concepts"</a>.


---+++Terminology: Character definition

The <b>*Character List</b> (= <b>*Character Descriptions</b>) <a href="SDD_DELTA_Directives.html">directive</a> contains both the primary definition of the character and the states. An example for a character definition could look like (color markup added for the purpose of the discussion):

<span style="color:red">#</span><span style="color:blue">1. Stem &lt;presence&gt;</span><span style="color:red">/</span><br />
&nbsp; <span style="color:green">1. absent</span><span style="color:red">/</span><br />
&nbsp; <span style="color:green">2. present</span><span style="color:red">/</span>

The definition is delimited by the two symbols (above formatted in red):  <span style="color:red">#</span> indicates a new character, the slash ('/') the end of a text content. The slash is only a DELTA delimiter if it is followed by a blank or end of a line character. For example in: "<span style="color:red">#</span><span style="color:blue">99. Length/width ratio</span><span style="color:red">/ </span>" only the last slash is considered a delimiter. In general new line character are not significant in DELTA and blanks can be used instead. The following code is identical to the example above<a href="#FNLineLength" class="footnote">1</a>:

<span style="color:red">#</span><span style="color:blue">1. Stem &lt;presence&gt;</span><span style="color:red">/</span> <span style="color:green">1. absent</span><span style="color:red">/</span> <span style="color:green">2. present</span><span style="color:red">/</span>

The character definition (blue) contains the character number and the character label (which includes a definition of the natural language wording). Character numbers start with '#' to distinguish them from state numbers. Similarly the state definition (green) contains a state number and a state label plus wording.

*Character or state numbers:* In DELTA the number in front of characters and states serves both as a unique identifier to reference a character or state from within item descriptions, and as a definition of the sequence in which characters or states are displayed or reported. As a consequence, new character or states can only be added at the end, inserting them requires a revision of all item descriptions using this terminology. Also, it is not possible to have different character arrangements for different reporting purposes. In BDI.SDD_, the key values present at the characters and state definitions only define a unique identifier. The state sequence is defined through the sequence of states in the xml data stream, and whereas the character sequence is independently defined through inclusion of characters into trees (which are called Concept trees in BDI.SDD_). The sequence of characters in BDI.SDD_ Terminology/Characters should not be considered informative! To export characters and states to BDI.SDD_, the DELTA numbers can be used directly as BDI.SDD_ key values. However, to preserve the sequence of characters, in addition to Terminology/Characters, also a Terminology/ConceptTrees/ConceptTree must be generated, see <a href="#CharacterSequenceAndHierarchy">Terminology: Character sequence and hierarchy</a> below.

*Character or state labels and wordings:* DELTA interlaces the label and a wording for natural language generation in a single text string. To obtain the BDI.SDD_ Label/Text, one can either replace the DELTA "comment" markers (&lt;&gt;) with parenthesis ("(" and ")") or omit them altogether. Some DELTA character definitions are designed such that the best label is obtained by omitting the comment markers ("Stem &lt;presence&gt;" would become "Stem presence". A DELTA conversion utility could display a preview of characters and ask whether to convert comments in labels with parentheses or without. Otherwise, the generally acceptable conversion would be to place the comments in parentheses ("Stem &lt;presence&gt;" becomes "Stem (presence)"). This applies to both character and states: In the example above, "absent" could also be "absent &lt;or contracted and invisible&gt;". The BDI.SDD_ Label/Wording/TextBefore (for characters) or Label/Wording/Text (for states) is obtained by stripping any comment from the DELTA character or state name.

<p class="small">The DELTA strategy of interlacing different text representations has the advantage that whenever a change is made, both representations are changed together. It provides for compact, albeit somewhat difficult to read definitions. In English it works quite well to produce natural language descriptions, and in many languages acceptable compromises can be found. However, the mixed representation does put severe constraints on which natural language texts can be produced (or conversely, how readable the character or state labels in interactive use are). Finding good compromises between these purposes requires a significant amount of experience from the biologist starting with structured descriptions. The BDI.SDD_ standard has therefore decided to provide separate data elements for the label and the natural language wording.</p>   

*Inner comments:* The character or state label may contain comments within comments. How these are to be interpreted is in part defined by the <a href="#DeltaOmitInnerComments">*Omit Inner Comments</a> directive (see below).

*Units:* The character definition of a numerical character in DELTA could read: "<span style="color:red">#</span><span style="color:blue">2. Stem &lt;height&gt;</span><span style="color:red">/ </span><span style="color:#CC6600">cm</span><span style="color:red">/</span>". The part after the character label that is shown in brown is intended for a unit of measurement. If the plant height is measured only as the maximum (see <a href="#DeltaOmitLowerForCharacters">*Omit Lower For Characters</a> directive), DELTA may produce "Stem up to 150 cm". However, some DELTA programs use the unit element also for categorical characters. In this case it defines a text that is output after the list of states. To convert DELTA data to BDI.SDD_ the suggested rule is: for numerical characters write the unit text to Numerical/MeasurementUnit, for categorical or even text characters write it to Label/Representation/Wording/TextAfter (both within Characters/Character).

---+++Terminology: Character sequence and hierarchy

DELTA provides a limited character hierarchy in the form of the <a href="#DeltaCharacterHeadings">*Character Headings</a> and <a href="#DeltaItemSubheadings">*Item Subheadings</a> directives. Since an BDI.SDD_ concept tree has to be created anyways to store the character sequence, one may as well also evaluate these frequently used DELTA directives.

Always create a concept tree of the type "UserDefinedHierarchy" and the role "GeneralDefault". If *Character Headings is present, the tree should be based on the headings as nodes, and the sequence of characters in the DELTA *Character List as leaves. If *Character Headings is absent, the characters are listed directly in the root node.

If both the *Character Headings and *Item Subheadings directives are present, a second tree should be created, again using the headings from *Item Subheadings and the sequence from the *Character List. Both trees are of type user defined, but now the roles GeneralDefault and TerminologyEditorView should be added to the first, and only the role NaturalLanguageReporting to the second.


---+++INCOMPLETE, MORE TO COME!

Add: discussion of text character @@@@

Add: unit (i.&nbsp;e. a second text following the first character label) in the case of categorical character types (OM or UM): Add to label plus use as TextAfter






---++Advanced conversion concepts

Comments inside the item descriptions can be analyzed and compared with lists of known frequency (usually, rarely, etc.), probability (probably, perhaps) or other modifiers (strongly, at the tip, etc.). In the future such lists should be downloadable as multilingual templates that help in setting up new projects. If a modifier is recognized, instead of converting the DELTA comment into a Note, it would be translated into a modifier. This process is employed, for example, by DeltaAccess to support modifiers despite the limitations of the DELTA format.

Based on the list of directives shown in "Complexity of BDI.SDD_ versus DELTA", the following table annotates advanced DELTA directives as to how they map to concepts in BDI.SDD_. *Currently this is just a first start, this needs to be further worked out! Also note that many special directives are not yet supported in BDI.SDD_. The reason for this is that first the general structures of BDI.SDD_ should become stable. We believe that the special problems dealt with in these directives can later easily be integrated into the BDI.SDD_ structure.*

<tr valign="top"><td><b><a name="DeltaCharacterImages">*Character Images</a></b></td><td>BDI.SDD_ distinguishes between images intended for selecting a character or state, and images supporting the definition of the character in general. In most cases these images will be useful as Label/Representation/Selector media resources. However, one should remember that DELTA provides no images for states. Instead, the Character images are overlayed using a proprietory mechanism similar to the html usemap/map/area hotspot mechanism. No similar hotspot mechanism is defined in BDI.SDD_ (it would conflict with the desired multi-resolution support for media resources). Therefore, usually manual editing of the images to extract state-specific selectors will be necessary to port DELTA identification keys containing images.</td></tr>

Importing them will simplify later manual restructuring of a project. Background: Intkey specific directive to "allows selection of character keywords from image screens (instead of from text screens)". The DELTA User Guide does not define what a character keyword is, but probably this refers to the use of the "*Define Characters directive". <!-- DELTA: "specifies information on character keyword images and associated annotation for use with Intkey.

It would be possible to provide a common-root-URL in the project definition, which could be left empty, if multiple roots are used. The disadvantage would be that consumers of BDI.SDD_ data would have to follow this logic, combining each URL to a full URL. Currently this is not implemented in the BDI.SDD_ model. Instead each media resource URL is expected to be complete. Nevertheless, applications can easily analyze the start of the used URLs and automatically extract a root-URL from these, truncating the individual URLs to relative values.
