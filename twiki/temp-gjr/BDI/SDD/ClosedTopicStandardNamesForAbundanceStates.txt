Are there any standard English names for the basic states of an Abundance character? This might be a place there could be mild agreement on some globally defined state names and their semantics (or lack thereof).

I am not sure what you mean: do you mean a frequency modifier (frequently/usually/rarely) applied to a character state (-> "usually brown legs"), or do you mean the abundance of biological taxa in a geographic range?

Regarding the first: it would be good to define a template frequency modifier list and prepare it for multiple audience representations to save time when setting up a project. There is a proposal when discussing modifiers on the BDI.SDD_ pages: <a href="http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-BDI.SDD_/docs/SDD_P_ModifierFrequency.html">Frequency modifiers</a>, see also <a href="http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-BDI.SDD_/docs/SDD_P_Modifier_Overview.html">Modifier overview</a>.

The latter could be defined as a template concept. I have no proposal so far for the latter, please do submit one!

No, I meant aboundace of taxa in a geographic range. -- Main.BobMorris - 16 Apr 2004
