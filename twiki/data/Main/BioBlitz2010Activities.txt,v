*Bioblitz Activities*

Confirmed: Moth night lighting <br>
Hannu would organize this event, ideally by arranging his housing at the MBL cottages. This would be an evening affair and would include both light and bait traps. At least one station and possibly more depending on interest.

Confirmed: MRC Dockside <br>
Bill will provide support and narrative for sampling the benthic fauna of the MBL dock and immediate surroundings (could include dredging with a whaler in Eel Pond). A identification station will be set up on the dock or in the MRC facility with scope. Could include MRC inventory too.

Confirmed: Crane Wildlife Reserve <br>
One or more groups will explore Crane Wildlife Reserve. Suggest botanical and entomological/zoological groups. Abundant and diverse habitats for sampling.

Confirmed: Seining Garbage Beach <br>
This event will include at least one hour of seining at the beach. It could also include additional snorkeling time either in the area of the beach or at other locations. This trip will also involve bringing samples back to the MRC dock station or to the Loeb lab for additional identification.

Confirmed: Naushon birding <br>
Ellie will take a small group on a botany and birding tour of Naushon. This will be a full day trip with limited number of openings but offers a special opportunity to pristine habitats.

Confirmed: Gemma Field Trip <br>
We could schedule more than one trip. Each is 1.5 hours dock to dock. Will include dredge and plankton net. Can confirm once dates are secured. Could support as many trips as interest and funding allow.

Proposed: Waquoit Bay <br>
The Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve would provide access to estuarine habitat.

Proposed: Cape Cod National Seashore <br>

Proposed: Martha's Vineyard Sandplain <br>
I'd recommend going to a couple of plant diversity hotspots. If we went to Katama, we could see the island's best sandplain grassland and our current restoration experiment there. A stop in the MV state forest (more rare species than any other Mass DCR property) would also be good. 

Proposed: Webster Woods <br>
This trip would be a walking trip to the Webster Woods area. This area includes deciduous woodlands and vernal pools. Easy access from Woods Hole.

Proposed: Woods Hole Botanical Walk <br>
Jenny will take participants on a tour through Woods Hole village to a number of different habitats with sufficient time at each to inventory plants and animals with an emphasis on botany.



*Lab resources*
Proposed: Loeb lab space <br>
Seeking to identify large-footprint lab space to host the Bioblitz headquarters for the day of the event. This facility would provide space for developers and technical component as well as space for species identification and imaging.

Proposed: Zeiss Lab <br>
Exploring the possibility of the MBL Zeiss facility to provide equipment to support the Bioblitz. This might include the installation of microscopy and imaging equipment in the Bioblitz laboratory (See Loeb Lab Space) and possibly additional optics. 

Confirmed: SEM Facility <br>
Louis Kerr has compound, dissecting and SEM that all record great images. Could support specalised imaging.
