*How will data be reported?* <br>
We will encourage participants to experiment with any reporting mechanism they choose. But we want to provide clear guidance to those who seek it, e.g. "Use Twitter, with the following conventions ..." or "Use the iPhone app developed by ...".
----
*How will data be represented and stored?* <br>
However the observation are reported, they should probably be transformed into linked data, either as occurrence records with predicates "has_observer", "has_taxon", "has_location", "has_timestamp", or with the following basic (reified) format: "Person P said "Taxon T was observed at Location L at !DateTime D".

(This could be considered a sort of Darwin Core lite, which has been one of the requests from recent Citizen Science breakouts.) 

What scheme should we use for identifying taxa? (!http://bio2rdf.org/taxon:[ncbi_id] ?)

How should we identify locations? (!GeoNames?)

With this raw data, we should be able to infer a number of assertions (e.g. triples using the !GeoSpecies:isExpectedIn property).
----
*How should data be presented to users?* <br>
(Other than by providing a SPARQL endpoint.)

- real time stats reports (reports/charts by taxon group, locality, collector? etc)

- maps

- images of specimens/observations

Cynthia Parr has produced BioBlitzTallymaster software for visualizing results.
