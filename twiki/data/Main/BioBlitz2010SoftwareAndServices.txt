---++++ODK (Open Data Kit)
A Google / Android effort at mobile data capture.  [[http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/][Website]]

My (Kevin Richards), not so successful, attampt at an ODK Form.  [[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/viewfile/Main/BioBlitz2010SoftwareAndServices?rev=1;filename=Observe.xml][Observe Form]]
The problems I had were:

- DwC has a single field name (dwc:associatedMedia) to represent Images and Sounds - so the xml field name to link to a field opn the form was the same - this may have caused problems (I never worked this out)

- When I downloaded it and tried to import it into a local version of ODK Aggregate it prodcued an error (something was "" when it was expecting a value??)
