---++ Guidelines for programmers that want to contribute to the Bioblitz

First of all, if you want to participate in programming for the Bioblitz, we recommend that you to subscribe and introduce yourself at the mailing list at [[http://groups.google.com/group/tdwg-bioblitz][Bioblitz mailing list]].

All the data collected during the Bioblitz will be stored on a [[http://tables.googlelabs.com/][Fusion Table]] created for the event. Google Fusion Tables is a kind of shared database online that will allow us to manage data input by many contributors to this Bioblitz. All contributors are asked to insert their data there. Check out the documentation of the [[http://code.google.com/apis/fusiontables/][Fusion Tables API]] for info on how to insert data.

The main information you need to know is:

   * You will need to be authorized to write into this table. Write a message to the mailing list and we will authorize a Google Account that you will use to insert data.

   * The table in Fusion Tables that observations will be written is [[http://tables.googlelabs.com/DataSource?dsrcid=225363][this one]]. There is a [[BioBlitz2010TaxonOccurrence][page explaining each of the fields]] on this table. If you need extra columns on this table let us know on the mailing list.

   * There are some background processes that will analyze the data that is inserted on this table. So, for example if you write an observation with only a scientific name, it will get resolved using the Catalogue of Life 2010 and all taxonomy fields, and LSID, will be completed.

   * If you want to develop visualizations on top of all this collected data, you can just use the Google Tables API to access the data, or use the built-in visualizations capabilities of Fusion Tables. To view only, you don't need to be authorized to access the table.

   * It is possible to write observations on the table without a scientificName, but a picture will have to be added. There is an application that will let taxonomists help identify observations. Check out the [[BioBlitz2010IdentificationTools][page for this workflow here]].
