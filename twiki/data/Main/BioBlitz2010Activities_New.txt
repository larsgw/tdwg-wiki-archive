The TDWG Techno/Bioblitz will feature a series of scheduled field trips dedicated to species observations and collection.    The field trips are divided into two roughly equal blocks of approximately 2-3 hours with a few specialized outliers.  One block occupies most of the morning from 09:30 till lunchtime and the second occupies the afternoon from 13:30 till approximately 16:00.
Each block offers field trips that provide opportunities with the following general taxonomic focal areas
   * Insects and non-insect arthropods
   * Marine Invertebrates and Fish
   * Fungi
   * Higher Plants (including marine and estuarine)
   * Microorganism
   * Birds
   *Macroalgae (Seaweeds)

We expect to have all field trips provided with a local person with some expertise in the taxonomic area who can serve as a guide to the field trip location.  We appreciate any additional TDWG meeting volunteers who may wish to add their own expertise.

---+++Locations
Field trips include those confined to walking distance within the village as well as a few to some special external locations that require transportation.  These remote field trips, with the exception of the whale watch excursion (see below),  are all within a 30 min or less drive from the TDWG meeting. We will provide vans for transport to these locations.  The maximum number of participants for these off-site field trips will be dictated by interest, and the number of available vehicles.   These off-site trips will likely take more time given the need for transportation but have been selected for their relative species richness and specialized habitat.

Also note,  that there is limited availability (15 max.) to participate in a collecting trip on the MBL fishing vessel, R.V. Gemma.   
Whale watch excursion &#8211; We have made arrangements with a local whale watch company for those who are willing to spend an entire day away from the meeting for the chance to see the local marine mammal and pelagic bird offerings.   This excursion carries additional costs to participate and sign-up is via the TDWG registration site. 

---+++Schedule
The following list provides information about each planned field trip.  Note that there are 3 trips that fall outside the two major time blocks:  one early birding walk and two evening events.

The schedule has been developed to allow TDWG participants a chance to attend both Bioblitz-related activities as well as other side events that may be scheduled on Wednesday,  29 September.   Participants may choose to attend a mix of field trips, lab activities and meeting side events.   We have tried to have some redundancy between morning and afternoon trips to ensure there is something for everyone.
Each field trip is linked to a web-based poll where participants are encourage to express their interest in a trip.  Please try to limit your signup to no more than one morning and one afternoon event.    If you feel strongly about two parallel trips, put a number in braces &#8220;ex, (1) or (2)&#8221; indicating your preference.   We will close the polls on Saturday,  25 September at 1700 local time.   Additional signup will then take place at the main TDWG registration desk area.

Fluctuating water levels along pond shorelines maintain a diverse plant flora that contains many rare plants that are found only in these ecosystems. The unique coastal plain pond flora is threatened by municipal groundwater withdrawals, water level stabilization and nutrient loading from surrounding watersheds.  Join ecologist Christopher Neill of the MBL's Ecosystems Center on a visit to a pristine coastal plain pond in Falmouth, Massachusetts. This pond is an easy 20-minute walk through a typical Cape Cod forest. You will see more if you come prepared to wade in calf-deep water with either rubber boots or old sneakers.
