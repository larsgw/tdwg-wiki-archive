---+!!How to use the TWiki in Three Easy Steps!

   1 Register at the [[http://www.tdwg.gbif.org/membership/registration/][TDWG Registration Page]].
   2 When you want to add a comment on a page, click on the "Edit" link near the upper right corner of every page.
   3 Add your comments, click the "Preview" button at the bottom of the page, and if it looks good, click on the "Save" button to save it!
   4 To create your own pages, add a new TWiki.WikiWord to the page you are editing.  Once you save your changes, you can click on the question mark next to your TWiki.WikiWord to create the new page for it.

A Wiki depends on all of its users to work.  And that means that if you make a typo or can't figure out how to italicize that scientific name you're typing, eventually someone will fix it for you.  It's just the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyWikiWorks">way Wiki works</a>.

For more detailed information about what the TWiki is and how to use it, see the %TWIKIWEB%.WelcomeGuest page.

To learn how to do fancy things, like make *bold text*, _italics_ or bulleted lists, see %TWIKIWEB%.WikiSyntax and %TWIKIWEB%.GoodStyle.
