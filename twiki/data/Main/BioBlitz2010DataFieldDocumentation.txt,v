|eventID|A reference to the unique identifier for the field trip with which the observation is associated. Not all observations will be associated with events, and so this field will often be blank. This field could also be blank, since not all observation apps will have an eventID field. In such cases, we will try to add eventID in post-processing.|
|scientificName|The full scientific name, with authorship and date information if known, of the name in the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined.|
|vernacularName|A common or vernacular name used to refer to the taxon.   This may be useful for more precise subsequent species determinations when only an approximate identification is made in the field.<br>Example: "Andean Condor", "Condor Andino", "American Eagle", "Gänsegeier"|
|taxonConceptID|A resolvable external identifier for the taxonomic concept to which the record refers.<br>Example:urn:lsid:catalogueoflife.org:taxon:415e565-52c2-102c-b3cd-957176fb88b9:ac2010|
|occurrenceRemarks|Comments or notes about the Occurrence.<br>Example: "found dead on road"|
|individualCount|The number of individuals represented present at the time of the Occurrence.<br>Examples: "1", "25"|
|sex|The sex of the biological individual(s) represented in the Occurrence. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary.<br>Examples: "female", "hermaphrodite", "8 males, 4 females"|
|lifeStage|The age class or life stage of the biological individual(s) at the time the Occurrence was recorded. <br>Examples: "egg", "eft", "juvenile", "adult", "2 adults 4 juveniles"|
|reproductiveCondition|The reproductive condition of the biological individual(s) represented in the Occurrence.<br>Examples" "non-reproductive", "pregnant", "in bloom", "fruit-bearing"|
|behaviour|A description of the behavior shown by the subject at the time the Occurrence was recorded.<br>Examples: "roosting", "foraging", "running"|
|associatedMedia|A list of semicolon separated URLs of media associated with the Occurrence<br>Example: "http://www.flickr.com/photos/12978307@@N00/3624322607/;http://www.flickr.com/photos/12978307@@N00/3624322609/"|
|associatedTaxa|A list of semicolon separated taxa associated with the taxon at the time of the observation.<br>Examples: "host: Quercus alba", &#8220;prey: caterpillar&#8221|
|habitat|A description of the sampled habitat.   <br>Examples, &#8220;forest&#8221;, and &#8220;beach&#8221;|
|trophicLevel|We will use the controlled vocabulary Primary Producer (PP), Herbivore (H), Primary Carnivore (PC), Higher-level Carnivore (HC), and Decomposer (D)|
|verbatimLocality|Additional text descriptions regarding the specific locality.<br>Example: "100 m along the western fire road"|
|verbatimDepth|or organisms collected or observed beneath the surface of a water body.<br>Example: "100-200 m"|
|latitude|The geographic latitude in decimal degrees, using the WGS 84 spatial reference system, of the geographic center of a Location. Positive values are north of the Equator, negative values are south of it. Legal values lie between -90 and 90, inclusive.<br>Example: "-41.0983423"|
|longitude|The geographic longitude in decimal degrees, using the WGS 84 spatial reference system, of the geographic center of a Location. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it. Legal values lie between -180 and 180, inclusive.<br>Example: "-121.1761111"|
|coordinatePrecision|A decimal representation of the precision of the coordinates given in the decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude.<br>Examples: "0.00001" (normal GPS limit for decimal degrees), "0.000278" (nearest second), "0.01667" (nearest minute), "1.0" (nearest degree)|
|observedBy|Name of the person(s), semicolon separated, who made the observation.|
|recordedBy|Name of the person who is reporting the observation.|
|identifiedBy|A semicolon separated list of names of people, groups, or organizations who assigned the Taxon to the subject.<br>Example: "James L. Patton"; "Theodore Pappenfuss; Robert Macey"|
|identificationReferences|A semicolon separated list of references (publication, global unique identifier, URI) used in the Identification.<br>Example: "Aves del Noroeste Patagonico. Christie et al. 2004."|
|identificationRemarks|Comments or notes about the Identification.<br>Example: "Distinguished between Anthus correndera and Anthus hellmayri based on the comparative lengths of the uñas."|
|identificationRequested|This is a Y/N flag that indicates uncertainty on the part of the observer, and a request for expert identification. Including it willl allow queries (or RSS subscriptions) of the form &#8220;show me all unidentified butterflies&#8221;.|
|dateTime|Format is MM/DD/YY/24 hr time. Example: 08/04/10/23:30 |
|kingdom| Only kingdom needs to be filled out, to disambiguate scientific name. The rest will be added post-processing.|
|phylum| |
|class| |
|order| |
|family| |
|genus| |
|gbifIdResolved|The GBIF identifier to which the scientific name was resolved (post processing). |
