---+++Facilities

The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) is supporting the Techno/Bioblitz through the provision of a large open laboratory located in the Loeb teaching facility.   This room, and several adjoining rooms will provide ample space for supporting the event and will serve as the bioblitz &#8220;base camp.&#8221;  It will remain open throughout the day and evening of the event.    It will serve as a base for:

   * Identification of botanical and (small) zoological specimens.   We will provide jars, buckets and trays for capture and transport of small terrestrial and marine specimens to the lab for identification, scope work and image capture.   We ask those bringing samples back to consider returning live specimens back to their capture location.
   * Temporary (live) storage of small marine samples &#8211; The facility includes shallow circulating seawater trays for temporary storage of marine invertebrates, marine algae, etc.    We will also provide containers and small aquaria for temporary housing.
   * Microscopy &#8211; the MBL and the Carl Zeiss Facility are offering a range of microscopy and imaging equipment for identification and digital imaging of specimens.  In addition we will have access to a digital SLR stand with lighting for capturing high-resolution macro-photographs.   See table below for details.
   * Computing &#8211; The lab will provide computer hardware to support image capture for each identification station (below) the lab will also include space for participants to set up computers if they wish space for development.  In addition, a separate computer-support facility is available for coding and development at the MBL Club, which will supply power, tables, and network connections.
   * Macrophotography &#8211; the lab will support at least one digital camera stand with macro photography capabilities.   This setup will be staffed by a support person familiar in its use.

The basecamp provides bench space that will support 6 separate bioblitz identification &#8220;stations.&#8221;   Each station will provide reference materials, trays, jars, small tanks, as appropriate to each station as well as the equipment listed below.   Participants are also encouraged to bring their own identification materials and reference guides as aids for identification.   The layout is provisionally as listed below but final equipment setup will be laid out to maximize flexible use.
