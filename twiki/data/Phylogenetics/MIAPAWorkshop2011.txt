---+!! <center>Steps towards a Minimum Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis (MIAPA) Standard</center> 

%TOC%
---++ Synopsis and Goal

Many phylogenetic analysis results are published in ways that present serious barriers to their reuse in numerous research applications that would stand to benefit from them. While some of these barriers are well understood, such as issues with adherence to standard exchange formats, those centering on the associated metadata necessary for researchers to evaluate or reuse a published phylogeny have only recently begun to be articulated. One of the critical next steps towards formalizing these metadata requirements as a minimum reporting standard is to convene meetings of key stakeholder communities with the goal to identify information attributes  necessary and desirable for facilitating reuse, and to build consensus on their priority. To this end, we held a workshop at the 2011 TDWG Conference to determine how a future reporting standard for phylogenetic analyses can best serve biodiversity science and related research applications. We invited all interested colleagues to participate. 

After initial informational talks, participants self-organized into clusters based on [[MIAPAWorkshop2011Ideas][common interests]].
