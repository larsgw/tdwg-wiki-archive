---+!! <center>Sharing and delivery of reusable phylogenetic knowledge</center> 

%TOC%
---++ Synopsis and Goal

This combined symposium and workshop event aims to present and put to the test recent community progress towards effective sharing and reuse of expert phylogenetic knowledge, a key ingredient to addressing comparative research questions across biology. Even though many researchers would rather reuse a quality phylogeny than try to build it themselves, in practice it is difficult and often enough impossible to find suitable phylogenies, to evaluate their fitness for purpose, and to access them in a format suitable for analysis. To mitigate these obstacles, an interdisciplinary grassroots network has begun to develop solutions that include data standards, metadata ontologies, a decoupled architecture, and community-building hackathons. Aside from presenting the results of these efforts and showcasing diverse applications for phylogeny reuse, the event will allow participants to inform these efforts so they respond to biodiversity science needs. Finally, the event is designed to catalyze new collaborations by providing ample room for interactive demonstrations using participant-contributed research problems.

---++ Background

Phylogenies are fundamental to understanding how our planet&#8217;s biodiversity evolved, and to predicting how it might respond to accelerating environmental change. They are crucial to data analysis in many biological fields, including ecology and biodiversity science, to identify patterns in data while accounting for the non-independence of observations due to their shared ancestry. As a consequence, an increasing number of researchers require access to accurate and reliable phylogenetic knowledge, but lack the expertise in systematics to create it themselves. Even though a tremendous amount of phylogenetic knowledge is created and published by experts, and despite the existence of long-standing community resources such as the Tree of Life Web Project and !TreeBASE, reuse of phylogenetic knowledge is surprisingly low ([[http://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-5-574][Stoltzfus et al, 2012]]).

Several reasons for this have been suggested, including that suitable phylogenies can be hard to discover; their exact provenance necessary to judge their fitness for reuse is often unclear;  they may have missing or non-standard taxon labels; they may be available only as figures in journals; and their size, format, or some other property may make them difficult to use in the desired analysis program. To mitigate these obstacles, a grassroots network of information scientists, software developers, and biologists from a variety of fields has begun to develop sociological and technological solutions that will facilitate easy sharing, discovery, and reuse of expert phylogenetic knowledge. These solutions include metadata-friendly data standards, metadata ontologies, and an architecture proposal for a how a set of decoupled and distributed components can interoperate to support the predominant use-cases for sharing and reusing phylogenies. They also include community-building activities, in particular hackathons, that have successfully engaged practicing scientists and informatics experts from a wide diversity of backgrounds. 

---++ Agenda

The event will consist of two parts of about 90 minutes each, with a short coffee break between them. The first part is in the form of a symposium, and features six speakers from community efforts on phylogenetic knowledge interoperability and from phylogenetic knowledge synthesis collaboratives presenting short talks (10 minutes each), followed by 30 minutes of discussion with the panel of speakers.

After a short coffee break, the second part, in the form of a workshop, consists of individual software demonstrations to which attendees are invited to bring their own data problems (such as taxonomic name resolution and how to obtain the best phylogeny for a list of species) to evaluate hands-on the potential of the presented solutions for their research and data integration problems.
