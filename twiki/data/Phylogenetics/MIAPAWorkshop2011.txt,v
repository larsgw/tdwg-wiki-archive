---+!! <center>Steps towards a Minimum Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis (MIAPA) Standard</center> 

%TOC%
---++ Synopsis and Goal

Many phylogenetic analysis results are published in ways that present serious barriers to their reuse in numerous research applications that would stand to benefit from them. While some of these barriers are well understood, such as issues with adherence to standard exchange formats, those centering on the associated metadata necessary for researchers to evaluate or reuse a published phylogeny have only recently begun to be articulated. One of the critical next steps towards formalizing these metadata requirements as a minimum reporting standard is to convene meetings of key stakeholder communities with the goal to identify information attributes  necessary and desirable for facilitating reuse, and to build consensus on their priority. To this end, we held a workshop at the 2011 TDWG Conference to determine how a future reporting standard for phylogenetic analyses can best serve biodiversity science and related research applications. We invited all interested colleagues to participate. 

After initial informational talks, participants self-organized into clusters based on [[MIAPAWorkshop2011Ideas][common interests]].

---++ Break-out subgroup results
In the morning of day 2, we broke into subgroups to create checklists of terms and categorize these into minimum reporting requirements and ideal reporting practices. 

---+++ Group 1
Participants: Nico Cellinese (U. Florida), Nicky Anthony (UNO), Chuck Bell (UNO), Son Tran (NMSU), Hilmar Lapp (NESCent)

   * OTUs: All terminal nodes should be labeled, internal need not be.
      * A meaningful external identifier (a combination of database or resource and identifier/accession within that database).
      * For specimens, museum, collection (if applicable), and specimen identifier.
      * Sometimes, specimens aren't deposited in a museum collection; in that case, provide the laboratory, laboratory collection, and accession within that collection.
      * Precise (GPS) georeferences for specimens are highly desirable, but may not always be available. 
   * Branch length: some measure of branch length required. Further semantics of the measure should be implied by the tree inference method.
   * Branch support: some value of branch support should be provided, for example posterior probability, or bootstrap value
      * This would be highly desirable in most cases, but there is some controversy as to whether this can always be reasonably provided.
   * Character matrix: aligned data matrix that is the basis for the tree (by having been the input for the tree inference method)
      * Data type must be provided, for example DNA, RNA, protein, morphology, etc
   * Alignment method: name of algorithm or method, version of program, parameters (or default if default values were used)
   * Alignment correction: manual ("by eye")?
   * Tree inference method: name of algorithm or method, version of program, parameters (including model of evolution, and optimality criterion)
      * If (normally then morphological) characters were weighted, character weights need to be provided. (Typically, inference programs provide these in their log files, and thus the information could be copied from there.)

---+++ Group 2
Participants: Bill Piel, Jim Leebens-Mack, Karen Cranston, Teodor Georgiev

Our notes are [[Group 2 Checklist][here]], and here:

Our list of terms from initial brainstorming, which we them categorized into agreed-upon minimum and those that generated discussion (below). Note that we ran out of time to discuss our whole list, and the terms after specimen number never got categorized into minimum and non-minimum.
   * topology in digital format
   * branch lengths 
   * support values
   * method of analysis (ML / MP / Bayes)
   * samples with valid taxon names
   * character data
   * excluded characters
   * character sets / partitions
   * biorepository collection code
   * specimen number
   * (NB: everything below not categorized during discussion)
   * locality data
   * !GenBank accession number
   * tissue sequenced
   * molecular or morphological
   * alignment method
   * consensus method
   * software & version
   * character labels and states for morphological data
   * evolutionary model
   * heuristic search parameters / MCMC settings
   * random seed
   * input trees for consensus / composite trees

Agreed-upon minimums
   * topology
   * support values
   * method of analysis (ML / MP / Bayes)
   * unique and valid OTU label (valid species name, or specimen identifier that could be found in a database somewhere - using some informatics magic)
   * alignment used to construct the tree
   * raw data (pre-cleaning and alignment, e.g. !GenBank ID) 
   * alignment method
   * data assembly (how did we go from databased sequence data to final alignment); in the short to medium term, this would likely be text, not machine readable

Discussed:
   * branch lengths with units: ideal, but not required; morphological data may not produce meaningful branch lengths
   * metadata about OTU label
   * specimen data: if a study did new sequencing, specimen data should be included

Other interesting discussion:
   * distinction between what data should be available (the best practices) and how this information should be communicated (in text of paper, as digital object)
   * issue of something being required that might not be relevent for all studies (i.e. support values for a glommogram, valid species names for environmental samples)
   * best practices for analysis and data management: i.e. better to include all characters in matrix and exclude using software settings than removing those characters from the matrix itself
