---+++++ Content

Vertical distance point or range measurement in relation to a ground datum (such as water level, or the level of the sea floor for benthic samples).

This depth should be positive below the surface and negative above (e.g. collecting above sea level in tidal areas).

Although the depth could be covered by a generic element for site measurements, the separate Depth element is preserved for the sake of clarity.
