Examples: 'von', 'Lord'. Compare Title for 'Prof', 'Dr.' (vCard: N-Prefix)

The 'Full Name' for some of these items gets quite long when including the relevant information in context - would you want to define some codes for things like dataset, source, data collection, unit, unit record, etc?

Not really - I agree that this could be done later, but for the time being lets keep this readable.
