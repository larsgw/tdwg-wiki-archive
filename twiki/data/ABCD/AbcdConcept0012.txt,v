$$Walter$$ I have copied the content that you put in the previous technical contact attribute @@preferred. Did you want to be more specific in each attribute concept page - for example: did you want to put the documentation for the attribute for content contact as "A flag to set to indicate the preferred administrative contact for the dataset" and by the technical contact "A flag to set to indicate the preferred technical contact for the dataset" - or did you want to just keep it generic?
