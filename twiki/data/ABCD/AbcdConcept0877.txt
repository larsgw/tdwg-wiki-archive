Abbreviation representing the organisation acting as or associated with the gathering agent. For FAO/IPGRI multi-crop passport data (MCPD), this is the descriptor indicating the Institute collecting the sample (COLLCODE). If the holding institute has collected the material, this should be the same as the holding institute code (INSTCODE, in ABCD: SourceID). Restricted to 50 characters maximum length, including blanks (shorter recommended!). Label abbreviations are especially important when displaying information in a tabular format.
