---+++++ Content

The relationship of the unit gathered with other taxa at the gathering site.

Note that this relationship can be recorded as a feature of the location (e.g. a syntaxon, or certain species known to grow together at the site). It can also be used to record an observed relationship (e.g. caterpillar and observed food plant, parasite and host etc.), but this would be better expressed as a unit association.
