Attributes can be used to indicate a primary collector and a sequence number. 

The first collector, which may be flagged by means of an attribute,is normally a single person in charge of the field book to which records are added or the team leader. It may be the person whose collection number is cited but it could be an organisation name if the collector is not known. Further collectors who were part of the team or other individuals who may have passed specimens or data onto the team can be cited as well.
