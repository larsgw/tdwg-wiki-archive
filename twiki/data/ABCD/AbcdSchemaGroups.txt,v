_I also think that there is a mineralogy classification, but I'm not sure why that should lead us into trouble? If the result of an identification is a classified mineral, that is as good as a classified organism? Alternatively, we could delete the subgroups from Identification Result and deal with everything in the one Group?_

      * Of course, I assumed that we will author these things together, in the end. 

_ That's great - actually I think that we might be able to use some of the text from the RLG metadata guidelines (for which I was a joint author) in the section on character sets. I'll check it out._

      * Interesting. I am a novice to Wiki as well, so what did you intend to do with the <br> thing? 

_ The documentation claims that it introduces a line break, so helping to save some screen real-estate and distinguishing the subheads from the main headings. However, using it also seems to reveal the actual format codes. I guess it doesn't matter much so long as they can be distinguished._

      * I found that formatting generally looks much nicer using Firefox than with Explorer. You did note that the "level 4 subheads" are the so-called subgroups, did you? 

_I do have Firefox, but have not yet used it on the wiki. Yep, I did spot the relationship. _

      * Yes please, do go ahead. Do you intend to do it on the Wiki or in a word processor? I can work with both. Once you have something, let me know (although at the moment I manage less work than I had hoped for). This can also be helpful for Yael. 

_ I will transfer to using the wiki exclusively._

      * I am not too happy with that, [[moving][Record URI into Identifiers]] although I recognise the reasoning. I'd suggest to put it under Media, as a subcategory of its own (see below). What do you think? 

_Agreed._

      * I did not find the suggestion, but proceeded to make one myself (see below). I changed the Group name to avoid automatic Wiki linking, to AA. In this context, I think that there may be some useful bits and pieces of text (also for other parts of the documentation $$Yael$$) in the BioCISE Model article in Taxon (see: http://www.bgbm.org/biodivinf/docs/CollectionModel/)

_Agreed. I have changed the labels slightly to just "Associations" and "Assemblages" as the "of Units" seems to be redundant._

      *  Edit history: See suggested new label. 

_Agreed._

      * Basis and kind: I rather leave it under Meta as a separate subgroup same as identifiers (it is really more of a metadata item than identifiers, isn't it?)

_Agreed._

      * I mooved Sex and Age to MOF and changed the explanation of MOF to make it independent of the type (was already needed for Sequences).

_Agreed - good move._

      * I changed the Other group. 

_Agreed._

      * Again: I went through and changed the "Suggested Label" to "Label" where agreed and suggested some labels (for you to delete "suggested", if agreed.

_Done._

   **  Walter, I think that we are pretty much there wrt the structure and headings for the Introduction. Changes can always be accommodated if necessary but I think that we are sufficiently in agreement that I will transfer the headings to the Introduction page and start filling in the text. See you there, Neil.

_Agreed. I have used the latter._

_Agreed. I have moved it under Meta. It exists in v2.0 as the RevisionData group._
