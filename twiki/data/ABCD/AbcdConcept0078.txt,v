On this page and the former I listed an example from the schema but was not sure what phrasing to put in the Example Explanation section.
No problem here, the example is quite self explanatory. However, try to avoid words with combined Upper/lowercase, the Wiki recognises those as (potential) links. I think the hypenated form together with the example makes quite clear how the ITU thing looks like.
