---+++++ Content

A reference (e.g. an article or monograph) that was used as the base for the identifier's taxon identification (e.g. by means of providing a key or a description of the taxon). It circumscribes the taxon identified (and thus can act as a potential taxon's sec. reference).

Issue 1:  I think IdentificationReference and IdentificationSource have reversed names and semantics.  Source should refer to where the identification is recorded, while "reference" should refer to a publication used to make the determination, but not containing the identification.  

Issue 2:  Should we recommend that "field tag", and "determination slip" be recorded when something "usual" is the IdentificationReference.  In my experience, IdentificationReference is not recorded in cases that are typical (e.g., det.slip, field tag). The reference is recorded only when the reference is a published work and when that specimen's identity is a prominent feature of the publication.  Simply being listed in the material examined section would not be significant enough to warrant the effort of entering a special IdentificationSource record. (Listing in a material examined section would warrant a general bibliographic citation for a Unit.). Done.

$$Walter$$ Should these editorial notes be included?
