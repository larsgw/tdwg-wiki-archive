$$Yael$$ We have a little problem here. The Technical Contact itself is an Agent, but it functions as Metadata. I think we should group all items underneath as Agent, but the actual person etc. should be grouped according to their role.

I have copied the information from TechnicalContacts to this element instead (the parts that make sense in this context).

Perfect. Btw, the search for the $$ Walter thing has worked very nicely, try to use it for Yael. You just have to delete the $$ when you read and answered the message.

Nothing in the schema for this element - I just added a group - Agent. Should I take the information from Micro Agent-Contact etc?

$$Yael$$ The group is correct. The information belonging to this item is now under the container element TechnicalContacts. My suggestion was to restrict the text to individual element (i.e. this one, TechnicalContact), and restrict the documentation for the container element to group (container). We may still change our mind later on, but for the time being I suggest to proceed like that, i. e. to move the information now in the TechnicalContacts element to this one.
