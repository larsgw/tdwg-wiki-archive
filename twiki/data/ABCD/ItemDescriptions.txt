---++ Data items on the Wiki pages

The title is a arbitrary number for the concept that has been assigned automatically (ABCD Concept 0000)
*This item should not be edited!*

The next item is the XPath of the item in the schema. Again, *this item should not be edited!*

The following headings should themselves not be edited, the respective text should be added to a new line below the heading.

---+++++ Group
The name of the group the element is assigned to. A controlled vocabulary, see [[http://ww3.bgbm.org/abcddocs/AbcdSchemaGroups][Groups]]. 

---+++++ SubGroup
The name of the group the element is assigned to (see [[http://ww3.bgbm.org/abcddocs/AbcdSchemaGroups][Groups]]). 

---+++++ Full Name
A name that can be used as a prompt in a display. 

Fill in only for "leaf" elements, i.e. those that actually contain data in the XML document. 

Mostly shorter version of the "Documentation"

---+++++ Documentation
A short version of the content description. 

This is comparable to the Documentation tag in XML Schema. 

---+++++ Content
The full description of the potential content of the element or attribute.

---++++ Recommended or prescribed values
If certain values are prescribed or recommended, they are listed here (especially if abbreviations are to be used). 
Fill in only for "leaf" elements, i.e. those that actually contain data in the XML document. 

---+++++ Example Value
A list of example values. 

Please separate by paragraphs in the same order as the corresponding explanation. 
Fill in only for "leaf" elements, i.e. those that actually contain data in the XML document. 

---+++++ Example Explanation
Explanation of the examples given. 

Please separate by paragraphs in the same order as the corresponding explanation. 
Fill in only for "leaf" elements, i.e. those that actually contain data in the XML document. 

---+++++ Reviewer
The reviewer team in readable form plus date (e.g. B. Adams 3 Mar 2005). 

---++++ Editorial notes
Used for free text comments and explanations and for communication. Please use the following code to call the attention of a fellow reviewer:
$$Firstname$$. 

---++ Definitions

Collection, datasource or dataset. 
 
There are essentially three references behind this:
- The physical collection or collection object
- The dataset/database representing the entire database at the source
- The dataset that is the result of a query and is contained in the document received from the network. 

An additional complication is that the Unit may be a specimen or an observation unit. In the latter case, the difference between dataset and original (specimen) gets muddled, because there is no specimen preserved. 

It's important, to think these things out when you hit upon them. If unsure, leave me an editorial note. 

---++ Editing rules and conventions for item descriptions

*Reviewer* We can use this as a control that I (Walter) have looked at an item and consider the entry +/- finished. Please leave blank where there is no entry in the schema.

*$$Firstname$$* is used to call the attention of the respective editor to an item. Remove "your" tag when you answered or treated the problem. 

The*Full Name* category should be filled only for*leaf elements* (including all attributes).

*Container elements* that serve only to hold*unbounded elements* (e.g. "Technical Contacts" for several elements "Technical Contact") belong to the group Container and are not further documented; instead, the individual unbounded element is documented.

We generally refer to*attributes* in the text with the AT in front (e.g. @preferred). 

The Wiki concept pages that are repeats of the former concept page with an @ represent the content of the*attribute* linked to the respective element. Attributes must be treated like leaf elements in the documentation. However, there are standard attributs like language which chould get a standard text. 
 
As a rule, the group of the _"recommended" attribute_ should be set to the same as the corresponding element. 

In Editorial Notes, those items that should be considered for a*change in the next schema version* are marked with $$CHANGE$$.
