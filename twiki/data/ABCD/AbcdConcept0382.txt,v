The date of the unit identification event.

The date of the unit identification event. Identification dates are commonly incompletely known (e.g. only the year or year and month) or unknown. Sometimes identification dates are inferred from a researcher's visit or the duration of a loan.

The rather complex ABCD <verbatim>DateTime</verbatim> type is used, although many of its elements are not normally needed. As a rule, only the <verbatim>IsoDateTimeBegin</verbatim> element is mapped, which is the one used for searches and which can be used to construct identification histories. Alternatively, the <verbatim>DateText</verbatim> element can also be used, but it provides only for human readability. 

However, the elements for exact time and periods may be useful for time series in laboratory reports that can be formulated as a series of identification events, or where the result of the identification may be influenced by the duration of a detection process.

Can you check the English, please? The curly brackets are used to avoid links caused by included uppercase letters.

$$Walter$$ Some minor changes - can you review again?

Identification dates are commonly unknown (element optional), or incompletely known.  Missing information reduces the precision of the date (i.e., known only to Year or Year and Month).  Sometimes identification dates are inferred from a researcher's visit or duration of a loan.

See Date-Type for general usage.

We probably don't need IdentificationDate to support the full range of date time elements that are present in the DateTime.  It's hard to imagine a realistic case where time of day could be relevant to an identification.  If year is unknown, simple text will provide the only function needed -- human readability of the existing information.  (Retrieval and sorting by interval in the annual cycle, as we want to support with CollectionDate, is irrelevant in this case.)  A single ISO 8061 Date field, along with an IdentificationDate text is sufficient to cover the needs around this concept.  -- Blum, 2002-12-10
