Something I noticed in the schema itself. In some places the word organisation is spelled with an 's' as here and in other places with a 'z' (as in gathering agent).

I have tried to stick to british English throughout. One of the reasons is the use of -ise and -isation. American English does not allow this. Use of s makes it much simpler for non-English speakers, because there are no exceptions. However, some things may have crept in because of Gregor Hagedorn's use of American English.
