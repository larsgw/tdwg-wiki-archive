---+++++ Group

Gathering

---+++++ Subgroup


---+++++ Full Name

Derived gathering country name

---+++++ Documentation

The derived name of country or major region where the specimen was collected or the observation made.

---+++++ Content

The derived full name of the country or major region where the specimen was collected, or the observation made, interpreted in the light of contemporary geographical knowledge.

The use of this element is slightly ambiguous in that local practice might require either a verbatim quote from specimen labels, or standardisation by controlled vocabulary or lookup lists.

It is recommended that the spelling of the country should be that which is recognised by the International Standards Organisation (ISO).

The derived country name offers the opportunity to document the name under which a country is currently known, interpreted from an old or superceded name on the specimen label (e.g. Vanuatu for the New Hebrides, Sri Lanka for Ceylon, etc).

Separate fields for state/province and country are needed to adequately handle the situation with international collections.

If the name of the country where the plant was collected is unknown, then this field should contain the value 'UNKNOWN'. In this case, the ISO Code for Country of Origin field must have the entry 'XX', 'XY',  'XXX', or 'XXY'. All remaining 'location group' fields should be left unfilled.
