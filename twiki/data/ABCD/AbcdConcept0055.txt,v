The only comment I found was vCard:OrgUnit for this. Should I just put the text "Collection holder organisation unit"?

Perhaps the best thing to do is to mark this entry here with vcard (again, avoiding the wiki-problem with upper/lower/uppercase words) and later have a look at the vcard documentation under http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcard-21.doc. These things have been contributed by Gregor Hagedorn, and I have never really looked into it. Let's go ahead first and come back to this.

$$Walter$$ I have looked at the doc, but the information for Org.Unit was not very descriptive. Would putting something like "The organisational unit acting as the collection holder or with which the collection holder is associated" be ok?
