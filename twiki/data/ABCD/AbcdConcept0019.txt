Metadata referring to the received or the source dataset.

---+++++ Content

The metadata defined here can refer to (i) the source of the entire data collection or (ii) the actual contents of the XML document they are contained in, or (iii) both. In the first case, the metadata scope may be wider than the objects actually contained in the XML document. This can be useful for resource discovery (e.g. scope). Annotations for the individial items will specify the reference point.

If a history of the data collection exists (if it was revised or expanded in various projects or at different institutions), this must be reflected in the IPR statements and perhaps in the list of Owners.
