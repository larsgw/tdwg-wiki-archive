The unique identifier (code or name) of the institution holding the original data source.

---+++++ Content

The unique identifier (code or name) of the institution holding the original data source (the first part of a record identifier). In specimen collections, this is normally the institution or private holder of the collection itself. For herbaria and botanical gardens, the standard abbreviations should be used.

An institutional abbreviation, perhaps with indication of the standard it pertains to (e.g. IH-P for Index Herbariorum and the herbarium at the MNHN in Paris. In practice, this is a controlled vocabulary for many types of collection institutions, but inclusion of private collections must be made possible. 

For FAO/IPGRI and EURISCO, the source institution ID is defined as the FAO Institute Code of the institute where the accession is maintained, which consists of the 3-letter ISO 3166 country code of the country where the institute is located plus a three-digit number.

The units within the datasource are not necessarily all owned or administered by this institution.
