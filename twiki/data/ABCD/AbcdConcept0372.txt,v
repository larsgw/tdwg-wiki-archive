A (bibliographic) reference which has provided the unit identification (and - if present - the identifier's name and/or organisation). The entire identification event was taken from the source given here. 

It is not recommended to cite "field tag", or "determination slip" here as the source of the identification but to restrict this to published works. However, it is recommended to record the reference also when the specimen's identity is simply listed in the material examined section.  

Note that this is not the literature (e.g. key) used to obtain the identification result (see <verbatim>IdentificationReferences).</verbatim>

I am not sure I understand the explanation here. Does this item refer to a reference for - the source of the identification for the unit that is recorded in this unit record?? (not a reference for the identification of the unit itself but for the identification recorded here)?

Is it clear now? When I find one of my specimens cited in an authoritative work under a specific name, that name becomes a identification result, the author becomes the identifier, and the work is cited here. 

$$Walter$$ Yes, thanks.
