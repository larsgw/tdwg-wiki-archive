Gathering date (text)

---+++++ Documentation

The date of the gathering event in text format. 

---+++++ Content

A text version (alphabetic mixed case and integer) of the date that the gathering event took place. This element is meant for use when the date is imprecise, ambiguous or not in a form that satisfies the standard structured date format. It can also be used when it is important to record the verbatim representation of the date or when dates to be recorded are not completely legible. For example the day and month may be decipherable but not the year; the use of this field will allow recording of partially interpreted information. 

This field can be used to record generalised date ranges and irresolvable ambiguity such as different day/month order conventions (e.g. US/Europe) or to allow for multiple dates and periods. 

In the rare instances of dates for periods before the year 0000, BC and similar dates can be recorded in this field.
