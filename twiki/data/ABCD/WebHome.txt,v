---+ The TAPIR Specification for Datasource services
d8 1
a8 2
This wiki is meant to give a full specification for datasource services compliant to the TAPIR protocol. 
The protocol was developed in joined efforts to succeed the DiGIR and the BioCASe protocols. After some years of usage and several implementations for those protocols some missing functionalities have been identified which the TAPIR protocol hopes to have solved.
d10 2
a11 1
The wiki is edited in parallel to the first implementation of the TAPIR protocol for the [[http://www.biocase.org/dev/wrapper/][PyWrapper]]. This implementation work is done for [[http://www.gbif.org][GBIF International]] and is supposed to be a proof of concept. All decisions taken during this  work will be documented here to ease the development of future TAPIR compliant software and to assure the interoperability of TAPIR based software.

---+++ TAPIR Specification
   * TapirSchema: The latest version of the XML schema formally describing the TAPIR protocol for datasource services.
   * TapirSpecs: Additional information which is not covered by the schema itself. The specs here are driven by the PyWrapper implementation of TAPIR.

---+++ TAPIR History
   * [[http://www.cria.org.br/protocols/newprotocol.pdf][ProtocolProposal]]: The unified protocol proposal as presented in Christchurch, NZ for the TDWG 2004 meeting. This is the reference for the TAPIR protocol and all the implementation work is based on it as far as possible.
   * [[http://ww3.bgbm.org/protocolwiki][ProtocolWiki]]: The original wiki for the development of a unified protocol which lead to TAPIR.
