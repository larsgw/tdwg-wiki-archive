---+++++ Full Name
ISO 3166 country code

---+++++ Documentation

A 2- or 3-letter (ISO3166-1) or 4-letter (ISO3166-3) code for representation of the name of the country or origin.

---+++++ Content

The 2-,  3-, or 4-letter code for the representation of the name of the gathering country  using the codes assigned by the International Standards Organisation (ISO).

This field should contain a valid entry as defined by the International Standards Organisation (ISO Standard 3166-1), with the following exception: The 'XXX' or 'XX' code should be used when no country of origin information is provided. The 'XXY' or 'XY' code should be used for non-specific collecting localities, e.g. Africa, SouthEast Asia. 

Note: The letter code identifies a country name, NOT a physical territory. For the latter, there is a ISO 3166 numerical code. For exemple, when Germany reunified, it kept DE/DEU but changed from 280 to 276, while when Southern Rhodesia was renamed Zimbabwe it stayed 716 but changed from RH/RHO to ZW/ZWE.
