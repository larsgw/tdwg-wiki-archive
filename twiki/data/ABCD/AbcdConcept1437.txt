---+++++ Content

The extension is temporary and serves only to accommodate urgent inter-version additions to the unit-object schema [[in][the future to the the various schemas/objects used in ABCD]]. 

For example, if a specific community (e.g. culture collections) discover that there are elements missing in the current version of ABCD (as they did for 1.2), they communicate that to the group responsible for schema development, who will discuss whether these elements are already accommodated in the schema, if they are not and if they can and should be generalized, and where they should end up in the schema. IF the culture collection community needs to move rapidly (e.g. due to project pressures), they can add these elements to the current version as an extension schema under a structure that follows SDD's CustomExtensions element (CustomExtensions-CustomExtension-Any ##other). In future modular versions of ABCD, such a structure should exist in the root of every object/schema.
