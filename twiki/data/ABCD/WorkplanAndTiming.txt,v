@---++ Questions

*Yael, do you check the documentation against the schema? For example, I think that dataset does not have an attribute any more. 

*Neil, do you have XML Spy installed? *

*Neil, do you think there should be additional groups and subgroups? Note that these are also headings for part of the introduction*

*Did you all subscribe to the "editorial process" pages? 

---++ Calendar March 29 - April 13

---++++ March 30

We have compared some new features in the actual schema (on the [[http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/CODATA/Schema/default.htm][ABCD group website]]) against the new [[http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/CODATA/Schema/ABCD_2.00/cmflister/][CMF Lister]] version and found no problem. If we find out that some of the items (elements or attributes) are missing, we can add them lateron. 
Markus has now created the new Wiki pages under ["ABCDConcepts"].

Yaël can start editing the ABCD concepts.  

Neil has agreed to take on the introduction and the standard mappings. 

---+++ Editing the individual items (Yael)

Every item (element or attribute) in the schema has its own Wiki page (based on the cmflister software). We can freely edit everything on the page, a backup is made automatically. The predefined titles, however, should NOT be edited (see instructions under "ItemDescriptions". 

I suggest that Yael drives the process on this section of the documentation. This involves transferring the comments found in the schema to the appropriate parts of the WiKi page for the element, checking the English or providing the text where it is missing or wanting (and asking me whereever anything is not clear, which will probably often be the case). 

We will have about nearly 1500 pages, but several hundred of them are rather simple or even superfluous (e.g. all the different Language attributes, which really don't need much comment; this is also true for the container elements that are formed for every item that is repeatable - e.g. Datasets-Dataset will be two pages). However, Yael will try to make sure that we at least reach the bare minimum: having every "leaf" element for which comments make sense completely documented.   

---++ Contacts and editor's timing

===== Time zones ===
Time in Berlin: UTC+2, Time in London: UTC+1, Time in New York: UTC -5.

Yaël can start editing the ABCD concepts. I suggest to start on the Unit level.

First steps: 
Install the "XML Spy" software (there is a free version available which is perfect for our purposes).  
Register with the Wiki.

Yael starts with comparing the actual schema (on the [[http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/CODATA/Schema/default.htm][ABCD group website]]) against the new [[http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/CODATA/Schema/ABCD_2.00/cmflister/][CMF Lister]] version, which Markus produced.

This is to make sure that Markus' software produced a complete listing, it might have some problems with new features of the 2.00 schema. We need to know that by Wednesday, when Markus will create the new Wiki pages under ["ABCDConcepts"], following the new design laid out under "ItemDescriptions".

Markus replaces the "ABCDConcepts" pages.

Groups and subgroups: These are like titles and subtitles, forming a logical subdivision both of the list of schema elements as well as of the introductory text that describes the entire schema. They also form part of the data that has to be put into the Item Descriptions. 
Everybody has a look at the Groups defined under "ABCDSchemaGroups". Although these can be changed later on, this means a lot of work, so we should start out with a good scheme here. Are additional subgroups needed?

Neil, I think you already have some text on this, have you? Please let me know if you would like to try and drive the process in this section of the document.

The time of the day here is UTC+2, i.e. 7 hours time difference with New York. Until April 1 I am full time at the office. On April 1 and 2 I will travel, back Saturday evening. From that on I will be in the office during the week only from about 8:30 to 12, than back on line by about 8 pm.
