A number assigned to the unit by the collector or observer. Note that the respective collector's name is found under <verbatim>GatheringAgents</verbatim>.

---+++++ Content

The original number assigned to the unit by the collector or observer. The entire desiganation is normally composed of the name or initials of the collector(s) followed by a number. This number is essential for identifying duplicates held in different collections. 

This identifier should be added to the entry (for collectors) under <verbatim>Gathering/GatheringAgents/../Person</verbatim>, if such an entry exists. However, the collector (or collector abbreviation) and number can also be given in a single field (e.g. FAO/IPGRI multi-crop passport descriptor (MCPD), described in the EURISCO descriptor list dated July 3, 2002). In that case, the entire string may be entered here.
