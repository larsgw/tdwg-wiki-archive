So would this be (Container, Structural) or (Meta, IPR and otherstatements) be the groups to use?

$$Yael$$ This is clearly Meta-IPR etc. (Group name should be short: IPRS; I will ask if we can make a global replace of "IPRS" for "IPRS" in the ABCDConceptnnnn pages).  The Container-Structural thing is for containers that refer to many different things (e.g. Unit), here it is clear that everything contained belongs to a single group and subgroup.
