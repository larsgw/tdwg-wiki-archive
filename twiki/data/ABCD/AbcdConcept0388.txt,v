Please see the reviewer. You will probably update whenever you review this record anyway. I have copied from the schema this text for the reviewer for a number of elements so far. Is this you? I did not decipher some of the characters.

Reviewer has a line break character between M.D. (Markus) and myself. Please proceed as you did, I will later search for the strange characters and correct this in the schema as well. 

One thing I noted in your more recent edits is that the Full Name is loosing its "prompt-like" appearance. Try to think of it as of the text in a form, something like "End of identificacion event (ISO): 2004-12-17" looks better to me than "Unit identification period end (ISO): 2004-12-17". What do you think?

$$Walter$$ Yes, sorry about that. I hope to have time to review sections after and 'patch up', but will try to keep fullnames more concise.
