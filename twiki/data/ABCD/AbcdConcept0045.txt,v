Source for Dublin-Core standard element "Date.Created": Date/time when the intellectual content (project, term, description, etc.) was created. 

Initially, applications may set this to the system date for new data objects, but authors must be able to change it to an earlier date if necessary. If this is imprecisely known for legacy data, it may be missing here. Earlier versions in other data formats should then be mentioned in the copyright or acknowledgement statements.
