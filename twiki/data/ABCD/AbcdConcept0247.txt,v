Unit record administrative contact's inherited name

---+++++ Full Name


---+++++ Documentation

The inherited name of the administrative contact for the unit record, which is the lastname in western cultures. 

---+++++ Content

The inherited name of the administrative contact for the unit record. This may consist of family names, generational names, a clan name, parents or grandparents personal names, etc. The inherited name (this being the lastname in western cultures) may be compound (e.g. 'Fischer von Waldheim', 'da Selva', 'Silvano Morales'). Depending on culture, the inherited name is not necessarily the name of the parents nor common to a married couple. Therefore, 'family name' should be avoided even though used in vCard (vCard: N-Family).

The inherited name (this being the lastname in western cultures) may be compound (e.g. 'Fischer von Waldheim', 'da Selva', 'Silvano Morales'). 

Depending on culture, the inherited name is not necessarily the name of the parents nor common to the married couple and children. Therefore, 'family name' should be avoided even though used in vCard (vCard: N-Family).
