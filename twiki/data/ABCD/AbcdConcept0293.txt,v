Rank of associated higher taxon.

---+++++ Content

The rank designation of the associated higher taxon (above the rank of genus). The fully spelled out rank value (in latin but for the "unranked" term and the "group" levels). This can be used as metadata for any name for a taxon of rank above the genus-level.
It is strongly recommended to use this element, since a rank value is required in order to transform ABCD data for higher taxa to Darwin Core. Please note that this is not the abbreviation for a rank that is used in a botanical infraspecific name, as it appears in the name.

The text looks ok to me, I made some changes that I think make it clearer. However, I dont have background in taxonomy so I do not represent the intended audience here...perhaps your phrasing was better? what do you think?

$$Yael$$ Since you're asking, I will not simply delete these comments (which is what I normally do when I think everything is OK). Your editing was perfect - I only replaced the DWC abbreviation you (correctly) introduced with the standard's spelled out name. Please delete these notes when you read them.

Rank of associated higher taxon.

The rank designation of the associated higher taxon (above the rank of genus). The the fully spelled out rank value (in latin but for the "unranked" term and the "group" levels) that can be used as metadata for any name for a taxon of rank above the genus-level. It is strongly recommended to use this attribute, because without a rank value, the ABCD data for higher taxa cannot be transformed to DwC. Please note that this is not the abbreviation for a rank that is used in a botanical infraspecific name, as it appears in the name.

This is not  the abbreviation for a rank that is used in a botanical infraspecific name, as it appears in the name [WGB].

Should this be an enumerated type, or will we have to split RankType into ICxN-specific, or even discipline-specific versions?  For example, the rank "Tribe" has different positions in Entomology and Ichthyology [DH].

The controlled vocabulary must contain terms with spaces [WGB].
