---+++++ Full Name
ISO 3166 country code

---+++++ Documentation

A 2- or 3-letter (ISO3166-1) or 4-letter (ISO3166-3) code for representation of the name of the country or origin.

---+++++ Content

The 2-,  3-, or 4-letter code for the representation of the name of the gathering country  using the codes assigned by the International Standards Organisation (ISO).

This field should contain a valid entry as defined by the International Standards Organisation (ISO Standard 3166-1), with the following exception: The 'XXX' or 'XX' code should be used when no country of origin information is provided. The 'XXY' or 'XY' code should be used for non-specific collecting localities, e.g. Africa, SouthEast Asia. 

Note: The letter code identifies a country name, NOT a physical territory. For the latter, there is a ISO 3166 numerical code. For exemple, when Germany reunified, it kept DE/DEU but changed from 280 to 276, while when Southern Rhodesia was renamed Zimbabwe it stayed 716 but changed from RH/RHO to ZW/ZWE.

See comments under Country.

This field should contain a valid entry as defined by the International Standards Organisation (ISO Standard 3166-1)

Two other entries are permitted in addition to those defined by ISO. If the name of the country where the plant was collected is unknown, then this field should contain the value 'XX'; if a country name is not applicable then the field should contain the value 'XY'. In these cases, the Country field must have the entry 'UNKNOWN'. All remaining 'location group' fields should be left unfilled.

The ISO codes in ISO Code for Country of Origin field assist updating and cross referencing countries where boundaries change.

The 'XX' code should be used when no country of origin information is provided. The 'XY' code should be used for non-specific collecting localities, e.g. Africa, SouthEast Asia

This element is also covered by various geographic standards and may be better covered by reference to these [JRC]

$$Walter$$ The fullname listed in the schema specifies (2-letter) but the description specifies 2 or 3 or 4-letter. Which is it? Also, some of the information I copied seems to be for 2-letter and other for 3-letter. I will wait until you have a chance to review this and clarify the relevant information before editing...
