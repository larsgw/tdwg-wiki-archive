Is this concept a copy of Technical contact with preferred attribute? Should I just copy the information in Technical Contact to this concept as well?

No, this is the attribute itself. It can contain data same as an element, so you can treat it as such. Example above. In this case not very much of content, because the type is boolean ... Please revise the Alemañol.
