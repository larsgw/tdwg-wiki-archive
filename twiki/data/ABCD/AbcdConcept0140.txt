---+++++ Content

A unique identifier for the unit record within the data source. The unit ID should provide the key by which a specimen or specimen component can be identified. 

Preferrably, the unit ID should be stable in the database, so that it also can be used to find the same record again (e.g. for data exchange purposes). The unit ID constitutes the third part of the globally unique record identifier.

Equivalent to an accession number which is unique inside the collection; if this is the case, the accession number should be entered both here and under AccessionNumber.

In many culture collections, the strain forms the unique identifier and should be entered here (as well as under Strain, AbcdConcept1443).
