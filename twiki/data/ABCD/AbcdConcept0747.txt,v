Only comments I transferred from schema were for FAO Institute code...

An error? I don't find this in the Schema.  FAO Institute code and this are different things. I have noted that the document describing the Mapping for EURISCO (plant genetic resources) descriptors is missing on the ABCD site, although it is an old draft, it may help you to extract some descriptive information. As noted in the introduction, there are several data items which map to FAO/IPGRI field, this is something that should be mentioned.    See item 738 for an example [[did][you note that you can simply change to URL to go to a different item and edit it? Firefox Tabs come in handy here.]]. 

$$Walter$$ - yes, an error, i meant to put this comment to you under LocationSafetyDuplicates (743). (Yes, I had noted that its possible to change URL...)
