---+++++ Group

Gathering

---+++++ Subgroup


---+++++ Full Name

Gathering country name

---+++++ Documentation

The name of the country or major gathering region of a specimen or observation.

---+++++ Content

The full name of the country or major region where the specimen was collected, or the observation made.

The use of this element is slightly ambiguous in that local practice might require either a verbatim quote from specimen labels, or standardisation by controlled vocabulary or lookup lists.

It is recommended that the spelling of the country be that which is recognised by the International Standards Organisation (ISO).

For cases where country names or boundaries have changed, it is recommended that new country names be enclosed in square brackets, after the old country name. The 2-letter ISO codes in the ISO Code for Country of Origin field assist with updating and cross referencing country names where boundaries change.

Separate fields for state/province and country are needed to adequately handle the situation with international collections.

If the name of the country where the plant was collected is unknown, then this field should contain the value 'UNKNOWN'. In this case, the ISO Code for Country of Origin field must have the entry 'XX' or 'XY'. All remaining 'location group' fields should be left unfilled.
