Is the generic description for parameter I found in the schema ok for this element? Should I take out the  examples like width, circumference etc.?

The parameter element makes sense only where the measurmentOrFact type is used to describe "open" measurements, where the users decide what it is what is measured. Altitude etc. are a special case, the parameter is actually always altitude. A solution to this would be to exclude this from the MoF and put it into an extension, only used when general measurements are asked for. I added this to the Schema discussion page. For the time being, the above (English?) can serve as a template for similar cases (depth etc.).
