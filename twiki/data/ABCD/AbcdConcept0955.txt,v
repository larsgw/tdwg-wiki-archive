Gathering country

---+++++ Documentation

Elements covering the representation of the gathering country and its name.

---+++++ Content

Details about the gathering country, such as the representation of the country and its name. This is separate from <verbatim>NamedArea</verbatim> for compatibility reasons.

Maps to Darwin Core 2: Country through either <verbatim>ISO2Letter</verbatim> (future) or <verbatim>CountryName</verbatim> (current). Historical country names and water bodies outside the coastal zone can be entered under named area.

<verbatim>CountryNameDerived</verbatim> is provided for a country name that has been derived (e.g.from a system supplied dictionary) by library consultation or other independent research.

At least one of <verbatim>CountryName</verbatim> or <verbatim>ISO2</verbatim> or <verbatim>ISO3</verbatim> should be present but more are allowed. This should be the political country having jurisdiction over the collection site.

Country names and ISO codes can theoretically be part of controlled enumerations but if included within the schema would blow it out to an unacceptable level; is it possible to refer to these lists externally with physically invoking them? [JRC]
