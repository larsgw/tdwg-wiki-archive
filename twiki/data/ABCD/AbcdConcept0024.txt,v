Free-form text describing geographic, taxonomic, or other coverage aspects of terminology or descriptions available in the data source. Source for the Dublin-Core standard element "Coverage", defined as "The extent or scope of the content of the resource". The comment in the ISO standard reads: "Typically, Coverage will include spatial location (a place name or geographic coordinates), temporal period (a period label, date, or date range), or jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity). Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN]) and to use, where appropriate, named places or time periods in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date range."
