So far, for these pages I have been using the term "unit". Should it be "unit record" or something else? 

$$Yael$$ Here, we should speak of Unit record; the same is true for the IPR Statements (next item in the schema diagram). I thought I got these things more or less right in the explanations on the unit-level, but found some exeptions (will change in the schema, too): 

The following should be "unit record" instead of Unit: 
Unit Content Contacts, .. subtypes of the unit (2 cases), Associations, Assemblages 

The following should be "unit" instead of Sampling Unit (a term not to be used):
Gathering

The following are correctly termed Unit: 
Source Reference, Unit References, Identifications, Kind Of Unit,  Multi Media Object, Named Collection Or Surveys, Measurements Or Facts, Sex, Age, Sequences.
