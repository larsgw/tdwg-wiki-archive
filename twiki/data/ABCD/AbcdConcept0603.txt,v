An alternative solution to this unstructured element would be the use of the scientific name structure given under identification.

It has been suggested to treat the type assignation as a special case of identification. Although this is without doubt true, it would mean to introduce the entire typification structure to the identification structure (because more than on name may be directly typified by the same specimen). As nomeclatural types are only a subtype of specimens, and these are only a subtype of units, it was decided to assign the typified name in the specimen domain.  If it is to be found by a normal name search, it should be repeated as an identified name under identifications.
