Rank of associated higher taxon

---+++++ Documentation

Rank of associated higher taxon.

---+++++ Content

The rank designation of the associated higher taxon (above the rank of genus). The fully spelled out rank value (in latin but for the "unranked" term and the "group" levels). This can be used as metadata for any name for a taxon of rank above the genus-level.
It is strongly recommended to use this element, since a rank value is required in order to transform ABCD data for higher taxa to Darwin Core. Please note that this is not the abbreviation for a rank that is used in a botanical infraspecific name, as it appears in the name.
