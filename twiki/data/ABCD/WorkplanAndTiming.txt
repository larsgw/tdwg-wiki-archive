---++ Questions

*Yael, do you check the documentation against the schema? For example, I think that dataset does not have an attribute any more. 

*Neil, do you have XML Spy installed? *

*Neil, do you think there should be additional groups and subgroups? Note that these are also headings for part of the introduction*

*Did you all subscribe to the "editorial process" pages?

We have compared some new features in the actual schema (on the [[http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/CODATA/Schema/default.htm][ABCD group website]]) against the new [[http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/CODATA/Schema/ABCD_2.00/cmflister/][CMF Lister]] version and found no problem. If we find out that some of the items (elements or attributes) are missing, we can add them lateron. 
Markus has now created the new Wiki pages under ["ABCDConcepts"].

YaÃ«l can start editing the ABCD concepts.  

Neil has agreed to take on the introduction and the standard mappings. 

---+++ Editing the individual items (Yael)

Every item (element or attribute) in the schema has its own Wiki page (based on the cmflister software). We can freely edit everything on the page, a backup is made automatically. The predefined titles, however, should NOT be edited (see instructions under "ItemDescriptions". 

I suggest that Yael drives the process on this section of the documentation. This involves transferring the comments found in the schema to the appropriate parts of the WiKi page for the element, checking the English or providing the text where it is missing or wanting (and asking me whereever anything is not clear, which will probably often be the case). 

We will have about nearly 1500 pages, but several hundred of them are rather simple or even superfluous (e.g. all the different Language attributes, which really don't need much comment; this is also true for the container elements that are formed for every item that is repeatable - e.g. Datasets-Dataset will be two pages). However, Yael will try to make sure that we at least reach the bare minimum: having every "leaf" element for which comments make sense completely documented.
