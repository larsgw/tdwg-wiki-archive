A higher taxon name associated with the identified taxon.

---+++++ Content

A generic or higher taxon name (monomial) in accordance with rules of nomenclature and associated with the identified taxon. This is not necessarily the result of the identification event, but a classification added to the result of the identification in the source database. Note that if a higher taxon such as a family name is the result of the identification itself, it should (also) be noted under Full-Scientific-Name-String (mandatory) and Genus-Or-Monomial (optional).

Associated higher taxon
d27 1
a27 3
A generic or higher taxon name (monomial) in accordance with rules of nomenclature and associated with the identified taxon. This is not (necessarily) the result of the identification event, but a classification added to the result of the identification in the source database. 

Although this is not really within the scope of ABCD's data domain, this item is kept for compatibility reasons (Darwin Core) and because for the time being searches are often executed using this item (although classification may vary considerably in source datasets). Eventually, we hope that this function will largely be replaced by taxon and name services defined and provided elsewhere.
a28 2
It is highly recommended to make use of the rank element, because this is a prerequisit for data transformation to Darwin Core.

Higher taxon identified for unit
d23 1
a23 1
The higher taxon name assigned to the unit in the identification.
d27 2
a28 9
A generic or higher taxon name (monomial) assigned to the unit in the identification, under the bacteriological, botanical, viral, and zoological code.

Rules:

1 First character must be upper case [A-Z]

2. Second and following characters must be lower case [a-z]

3. May not contain any other characters except dash.
d34 4
d48 1
a48 3
The rules above should apply to generic names under all codes; if an exception is discovered, the change in constraints should be implemented as an extension.

$$Walter$$ The element itself did not contain information, I took this from the Monomial type and edited to appy here. Or is it sufficient to just say "The higher taxon name assigned to the unit in the identification".
