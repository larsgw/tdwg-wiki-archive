I was not sure whether to include the line about the PreferredFlag attribute if there is a separate concept page for it anyway.

No harm to be a little over-explicit here. However, I think the name is just "preferred", isn't it? 
I suggest we generally refer to attributes with the AT in front (@@preferred). In fact, Attributes and Elements should be linked by hyperlinks to their respective page, but this is laborious and should be done later, if at all.
