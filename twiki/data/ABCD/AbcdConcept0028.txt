Keyword list describing the scope of the data source.

---+++++ Content

Keyword lists of geographical, geo-ecological, geological, and/or taxonomic terms describing the scope of the data source. In the case of projects that are in progress, scope may define the planned or intended, rather than the achieved, scope or coverage. If a scope is given, then the content available should be entirely within the scope, since this item is for resource discovery purposes. Compare also Coverage in DC.Description (which is language-specific). (Items from Scope may be added to DC.Coverage.)
