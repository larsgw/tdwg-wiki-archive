The date of the unit identification event.

---+++++ Content

The date of the unit identification event. Identification dates are commonly incompletely known (e.g. only the year or year and month) or unknown. Sometimes identification dates are inferred from a researcher's visit or the duration of a loan.

The rather complex ABCD <verbatim>DateTime</verbatim> type is used, although many of its elements are not normally needed. As a rule, only the <verbatim>IsoDateTimeBegin</verbatim> element is mapped, which is the one used for searches and which can be used to construct identification histories. Alternatively, the <verbatim>DateText</verbatim> element can also be used, but it provides only for human readability. 

However, the elements for exact time and periods may be useful for time series in laboratory reports that can be formulated as a series of identification events, or where the result of the identification may be influenced by the duration of a detection process.
