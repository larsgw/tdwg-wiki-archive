Authorship should be normalized as much as possible. However, some redundant authorship information (like authors before "ex" and after "in") are welcome to be able to generate full name-string (with author) variants. *Description of the type in the xml schema:* "The authorship and publication details (including the year on publication, the true date of publication, and the "in"-part of a citation)."

Fundamental issues about what sort of authorship information LC needs to track, and where it differs (by convention or by Code) between botany/zoology/bacterial/viral/cultivar domains is discussed under LCNameAuthorshipConventions. -- Richard Pyle - 09 Nov 2004

<h3>Discussion</h3>

With version 0.1.6 three alternative models are presented for discussion, please see LCCanonicalAuthorshipDiscussion016

<small>Earlier discussions: LC version 0.1.4 see LCCanonicalAuthorshipDiscussion014.</small>

*Schema type description:* "The authorship and publication details (including the year on publication, the true date of publication, and the "in"-part of a citation)."

Normalized as much as possible, but providing information about redundant authorship to be able to generate full name-string (with author) variants. Example: the author before "ex" should be given, although redundant.

Richard: Before we discuss too much the structure of authorship elements within LC, I think we need to first resolve some fundamental issues about what sort of authorship information LC needs to track, and where it differs (by convention or by Code) between botany/zoology/bacterial/viral/cultivar domains.  I have created the new page LCNameAuthorshipConventions to document these fundamental issues. -- 09 Nov 2004
