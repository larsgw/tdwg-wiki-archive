Provides codes for roles like author, editor, photographer, advisor, or copyright holder. This type is implemented as a union of all <nop>AgentRole* enumerations. It is provided for programming convenience and not currently used in schema. The roles and their codes used here are based on http://www.loc.gov/marc.relators/ (as of 2004/6 available at http://dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2004/03/Relator-codes.html). For example, the enumerated code "aut" for author corresponds to http://www.loc.gov/marc.relators/aut. The <nop>DublinCore Agents group is considering using the same codes (see e. g. http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/Agent-roles.html), but as of 2004/6 the <nop>DublinCore Agents subgroup did not yet agree on a Creator/Contributor refinement as qualified <nop>DublinCore. Note that the roles selected here are a subset of the MARC roles.

The following role subsets are defined:
   * <nop>AgentCreatorRoleEnum: Enumeration of roles supported for creator agents. 
   * <nop>AgentContributorRoleEnum: Enumeration of supported roles for contributor agents. 
   * <nop>AgentOwnerRoleEnum: Enumeration of supported roles for owner/copyright agents. 

   * (An additional intermediate <nop>AgentCreatorContribRoleEnum is defined as the union of creator and contributor roles (<nop>AgentCreatorRoleEnum and <nop>AgentContributorRoleEnum), for types where this distinction is not intended, but owner roles (<nop>AgentOwnerRoleEnum) shall be excluded.)

Enumeration of supported roles for owner/copyright agents. See <nop>AgentRoleEnum for information about the MARC relator codes.

Without changing the enumeration lists and semantics, a technical problem with Xerxes was resolved in newer versions of UBIF, see AgentRoleEnumXerces262Problem. -- [[Main.GregorHagedorn][Gregor Hagedorn]] - 12 Sept 2004
