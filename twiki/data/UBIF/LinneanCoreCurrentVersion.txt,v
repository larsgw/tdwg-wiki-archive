Gregor: the new version 0.1.6 is only a small increment, see link above for documentation. However, please let us focus on than the canonical name and authorship alternatives, discussed in LCCanonicalNameDiscussion016, LCCanonicalAuthorshipDiscussion016!

Richard Pyle: The most current version is the one that Gregor distributed at Christchurch, after his initial set of edits.  Subsequent tinkerings by me were not worth saving (for several reasons).  One of the Action Items is for Sally Hinchliffe to further develop the Christchurch version, and submit it to this group (targeted for November 5th).  That will be the Current Version, from which we can base our subsequent discussion. Note: Gregor: I fixed the file slightly on Nov. 3, to allow to view it in Internet explorer.

Sally Hinchcliffe - 05 Nov 2004	I have added version 0.1.3 in a zip file (internally I called it 0.1.2c), which also includes some instance documents which relate to the LinneanCoreExampleNames (at the moment there are only a few of these, but I will try to generate some more). Please note, this is mainly to trigger discussion. It was drafted by me with comments from Gregor and Rich. It has not been completely revised. If you open up the schema and look at the comments, those bits prefaced SCH are from me, and those prefaced GH are Gregor's fault. We have only really deeply thought about the following parts of the schema: 'Label', 'NameRecordId', 'CanonicalName', 'CanonicalAuthorship', 'NameExtension', 'Rank'. The rest are not much changed from Christchurch. 

Gregor: 8. Nov. 2004 -- After mulling over Sally's version over the weekend, I have uploaded a new version which is identical with Sally's except that both for "CanonicalName" and "CanonicalAuthorship" I have added a second proposal (see LinneanCoreCanonicalName and LinneanCoreCanonicalAuthorship for discussion) . I believe the way I changed the schema allows us to compare the original and my second proposal - so you would not have to download 0.1.3. Otherwise everything that Sally said is still true: the stuff to be revised towards the end has not been cleaned up any further by me. The only major change I did is to insert a dummy-copy of the current AlexandriaCore into the schema, since some foundation of this is necessary to discuss the authorship part.

Richard Pyle: Thanks Sally!  However, I wonder if it is possible to change the name(s) of the file(s) to relect the [[LinneanCoreChoiceOfName][agreed orthography]]: "LinneanCore", rather than "LinnaeanCore". I apologize for forgetting to rename the first version. -- 05 Nov 2004
