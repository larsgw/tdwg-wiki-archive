(An older discussion was moved to ClosedTopicTopLevelStructureDiscussions, because most of the structures referred there do not correspond with the current UBIF proposal.)

The currently proposed top level structure is:

<verbatim>
Datasets
  Dataset
	 Derivation
	 ExternalDataInterface 
	 Metadata
	 <single payload element (e. g. DescriptiveData or Units)>
</verbatim>

The term <nop>ExternalDataInterface should be changed, see NameForProxyOrInterfaceSection.

Since this page is again out of date as to what is the UBIF structure, I mean here to link to a discussion of <nop>ClassHierarchy objects. Someone should set a link to it where-sever such link best fits. -- Main.BobMorris - 06 Jun 2005  

Note: Unfortunately, the term "<nop>ClassHierarchy" is used for the hierarchy of classes that are being described (e.g. biological taxa) and should therefore better not be used for this discussion of classes in the schema. It would be better to update this topic instead, Gregor
