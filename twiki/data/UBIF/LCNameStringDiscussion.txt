Discussion on [[LinneanCoreDefinitions#NameStringDefinition][Name-string]]

Note Gregor: I summarized the first part of the discussion to refocus; please go back on the wiki to version 1.14 to see the full original discussion:
	* James and Rich discuss whether to distinguish between printed on paper (glyph) and its digital representation in a character coding scheme. The resolution was to limit string to character coding schemes (due to xml from the unicode family) and introduce [[LinneanCoreDefinitions#NameLiteralDefinition][Name-literal]] as an abstraction layer between Unicode string and name in general (including digital/electronic representations like a name on a JPEG of a label).
	* Some discussion about the use of "context" in the definition; the phrase in the definition is now replaced with "name within the scope of LinneanCore's domain". Rich: "Perhaps we need a different definition for "Code-compliant name-string" to accomodate the machine-generated "corrected" (= canonicalized, Gregor) strings? The Machine-generated instance might be considered as a [[LinneanCoreDefinitions#NameUsageDefinition][Name-usage]], and therefore its corrected nomenclatural representation could be considered as a *Name-string*.  
	* Rich and Gregor discussed name comparability and identity, from which a discussion resulted whether Name-string should be limited to scientific-name-without-authors, or should be a super term for all kind of scientific names, with or without author. There seems to be a feeling that many botanists in a name usage context consider the "natural" name to include authors, even though the ICBN defines the name object as without authors. Gregor proposed to have name-string, and introduce two new definitions: 
		* Nomenclatural-disambiguation: part of a name-string that disambiguates nomenclatural homonyms. This may include authors, publication year, or reference title.
		* Conceptual-disambiguation: part of a name-string that disambiguates concept usage. This may include fuzzy concept suffixes like "s. str.", "sensu lat.", "non author", and exact like "sensu/secundum publication reference".

Footnotes: <sup>1</sup>: Canonical Author name = this may be an abbreviation like "L.", an standardized inherited name ("family name, surname, father's name, depending on culture), or "given + inherited name". -- Gregor

Richard:  Thanks to Gregor & James for adding their terms.  If others wish to contribute, please insert your own column.  I've re-named the last column "LC Discussions", with the intention of populating this column with selected terms that we can all agree to use in future discussions.  I think we will have reason to discuss several of the items in the table above at one point or another, so it would be good if we could agree on a short (1-3 words) term for each of the most important items in the "String Term" column.  At this point, I honestly don't care what the terms are -- but it would be helpful I think if we could come up with clear terms for each, so we don't need to embed too many qualifications to terms in the course of our discussions. -- 2 Nov 2004
