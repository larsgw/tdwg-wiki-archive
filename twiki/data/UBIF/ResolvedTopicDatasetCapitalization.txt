Rather an esthetic issue: I find <nop>DataSets/DataSet odd-looking. I realize that you can write "data set" or "dataset". Googling "dataset" retrieves a wild mixture of both spellings, with "<nop>DataSet" used mostly in .NET/ADO.NET related documents. The <nop>DublinCore (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) uses "Dataset", with a lower case "s".

If nobody contradicts, I would prefer doing that. Main.BDI is taking the Dataset up from ABCD - was there a discussion in ABCD on this?

In English it should be data set (although Word recognises dataset!) and therefore I would expect to write <nop>DataSet but I don't think it is that important and will go with whatever decision - so I'll assume Dataset unless I hear differently.

Thanks. I think <nop>DublinCore usuage is good precedence. Esthetic reason is less the <nop>DataSet itself, but possible combinations like <nop>DataSetMetadataType. I will change to Dataset and <nop>DatasetMetadataType etc.
