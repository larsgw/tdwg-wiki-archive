These are some definitions proposed for use in further discussion.  Note that the word "name" is not on this list without some sort of qualification. We should all try to avoid using the word "name" without an explicit context. All definitions assume the scope of nomenclature defined for <nop>LinneanCore's domain, which is *tentatively* the Code-governed scientific names, plus possibly Trade Names, plus possibly some non-code-governed extensions of code-governed names [races, etc.], plus Linnean-type names used above the rank of Family (not technically governed by the Codes of Nomenclature -- at least not ICZN/ICBN.  Please feel free to comment/amend/etc., using the topics provided at the end of each definition. - 30 Oct 2004

#RankDefinition
   <b>Rank</b>: A specific, most-precise taxonomic rank (including intermediate ranks, such as "Subgenus", "Subspecies", etc.). See [[TaxonomicRankEnum][TaxonomicRankEnum]]. -- [[TaxonomicRankDiscussion][Discussion]]

#RankGroupDefinition
   <b>Rank-group</b>: The "full" ranking groups. Within the context of Codes of nomenclature, these include only "Family-group", "Genus-group", and "Species-group".  However, we will also need to deal with "Order-group", "Class-group", "Phylum-group", and "Kingdom-group" entities as well. Although "Phylum-group" is Zoo-centric, "Division" is used for different [[#RankDefinition][ranks]] by different disciplines (even different sub-disciplines within Zoology), and "Phylum" is only used for one [[#RankDefinition][ranks]]. Therefore, it makes more sense to use "Phylum-group", "Phylum", "Subphylum", etc. -- and assume that these are all precisely synonymous with the botanical "Division" equivalencies. -- [[LCRankGroupDiscussion][Discussion]]

#NameDefinition
   <b>Name</b>: A relationship between a name-literal (and hence name-string) and a named-object.  It is recommeded to avoid this word as possible, but sometime inevitable.

#NameLiteralDefinition
   <b>Name-literal</b>: A literal word (or words) designating at least one object.  A single name-literal may designate multiple objects (homonymy) and multiple name-literals may designate single object (synonymy).  A name-literal is an abstraction of a set of [[#NameUsageDefinition][name-usages]].  A [[#NameStringDefinition][name-string]] is an electronic representation of a name-literal.  A name-literal may have [[#VariantSpellingDefinition][variant spellings]]; each variant is represented by a [[#NameStringDefinition][name-string]]. -- [[LCNameLiteralDiscussion][Discussion]]

#NameStringDefinition
   <b>Name-string</b>:  The Unicode string equivalent of [[#NameLiteralDefinition][name-literal]] printed on paper or represented in an electronic document to indicate a scientific name within the scope of <nop>LinneanCore's domain. It does *not* include authorship, but does include markup such as parentheses around infrageneric/supraspecific [[#NameUnitDefinition][Name-units]], and infraspecific rank terms (e.g., subsp., var., f. etc.). -- [[LCNameStringDiscussion][Discussion]]

#NameStringWithAuthorshipDefinition
   <b>Name-string&nbsp;with&nbsp;authorship</b>: A [[#NameStringDefinition][Name-string]] that includes the Code-appropriate authorships embedded within the [[#NameStringDefinition][name-string]]. -- [[LCNameStringDiscussionWithAuthorship][Discussion]]

#NameUnitDefinition
   <b>Name-unit</b>: A portion of a multi-part [[#NameStringDefinition][name-string]] that constitutes one discrete [[#RankDefinition][Rank]]. There do not appear to be any cases where a single name-unit would contain a space (" "), but it may include a hyphen ("-") or other characters outside the standard letters.  It is a token composing name-string, technically. -- [[LCNameUnitDiscussion][Discussion]]

#NameUsageDefinition
   <b>Name-usage</b>: The appearance of a [[#NameStringDefinition][Name-string]] within a [[#ReferenceDefinition][Reference]]. -- [[LCNameUsageDiscussion][Discussion]]

---

(Here some preliminary attempt by Gregor to clarify the Protonym/Basionym confusion, therefore for the moment not alphabetical:)

#BasionymDefinition
   <b>Basionym</b>: A role a name can have in relation to another name which is explicitly based upon the basionym name. Specifically, in genus or rank changing recombinations ("comb. nov.", "stat. nov.") the new name is based on a basionym name. The basionym of a name is always a [[#ProtonymDefinition][Protonym]] (= [[#OriginalNameDefinition][Original Name]] or [[#ReplacementNameDefinition][Replacement Name]]). The role of the basionym is very similar to the role of the [[#ReplacedSynonymDefinition][Replaced Synonym]] in the case of "nom. nov.". [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#BasionymDefinition][Basionym]] -->

#BasalNameDefinition
   <b>Basal&nbsp;Name</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>basonym</b>:  A role name for a name in a nomenclatural relationship, including [[#BasionymDefinition][Basionym]] and [[#ReplacedSynonymDefinition][Replaced Synonym]]. -- [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#BasalNameDefinition][Basal Name]] -->

<b>Comment by F. Bungartz, Botanische Staatssammlung München, 12. January 2005</b>:
This seperate definition distinguishing basal name from basionym does not make any sense to me! Basonym, Basinym and Basionym are only spelling variants of essentially the same (see Dictionary of Fungi, 9th edition, 2001, page 61)! I do not understand the comment in the Discussion, that the Basionym (with "i") is supposedly the oldest Basal Name (= Basonym, without "i"). There are never several basal name! Every recombination goes back to the earliest legitimate name, which acts as a basal name (= basionym, basonym, basinym). To suggest that there is a succession of several basal names is nonsence (at least in Botanical Nomenclature). If the Zoological Nomenclature does not know the term basionym, how can it recognize the term basonym? This hardly makes sense.

#ReplacedSynonymDefinition
   <b>Replaced&nbsp;Synonym</b>: A role a name can have in relation to another name which is explicitly based upon the replaced synonym name. For example, if genus or rank changing recombinations would result in the creation of homonyms, a new epithet name has to be introduced to replace the previous epithet of the "Replaced Synonym". The replaced&nbsp;synonym of a name is always a [[#ProtonymDefinition][Protonym]] (= [[#OriginalNameDefinition][Original Name]] or [[#ReplacementNameDefinition][Replacement Name]]). This role is very close to a [[#BasionymDefinition][Basionym]], but ICBN (33.3) avoids the term basionym and uses this term instead. [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#ReplacedSynonymDefinition][Replaced Synonym]] -->

#ReplacementNameDefinition
   <b>Replacement&nbsp;Name</b>: A new name that replaces an existing name (= [[#ReplacedSynonymDefinition][Replaced Synonym]]). [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#ReplacementNameDefinition][Replacement Name]] -->


#OriginalNameDefinition
   <b>Original&nbsp;Name</b>: A name that introduces a new epithet and originally designates a type specimen (or other typification, including iconotype etc.). Multiple original names may accidentially based on the same type specimen. However, cases where a name is explicitly based to an older name (comb. nov,, stat. nov., nom. nov.) should not be considered original names. -- [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#OriginalNameDefinition][Original Name]] -->

#ProtonymDefinition
   <b>Protonym</b>: A name that introduced a new epithet the first time. This is the case in [[#OriginalNameDefinition][Original Names]] (not based on previously published nomenclatural names) and in the case of [[#ReplacementNameDefinition][Replacement Names]] (= "nom. nov.", = avowed substitute). -- [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#ProtonymDefinition][Protonym]] -->

<b>Comment by F. Bungartz, Botanische Staatssammlung München, 12. January 2005</b>:

This definition is NOT in accordance with the concept of a protonym as originally introduced by Donk (1960, original citations see below). Donk emphasizes that a protonym is a name that has effectively, but not validly been published. The definition given here, at the Linnean Core Website, does not make any statement about the way a protonym was published. On the contrary, it only suggests, that ANY name that ever was introduced for the first time is a protonym. This is not correct. Original names that have both been effectively and validly published are not protonyms, even though the definition presented here would just suggest that. Also, Replacement Names (= "nom. nov.", = avowed substitute) can be published both effectively as well as validly. Therefore, both Original Names as well as Replacement Names are NOT necessarily identical with protonyms!!!

In my opinion there is no reason to treat both Original Name and Replacement Name under one common definition. They are not the same and have little in common! An Original Name is ANY first name ever introduced for a species. It is only available for use if effectively AND validly published. However, any original name may nevertheless constitute a later homonym, i.e., if it is LITERALLY the same name as another name, which was previously effectively and validly published, but obviously based on a different type. In that case the particular name (the later homonym) is illegitimate and a new name may be introduced as a legitimate Replacement Name (= Replacement Name for an Original Name). This kind of Replacement Name will persist in all new combinations, i.e., it will become a Basionym for any new combination that takes place.

A second, very different case, is the introduction of a replacement name if otherwise a new combination would create an illegitimate name (= Replacement Name for an illegitimate New Combination). This is the case for a species epithet that cannot be transferred into another genus because this would there create a name identical to a name that already exists. This second kind of Replacement Name (a combination with a new species epithet) will disappear as soon as another combination is made. Thus, this second kind of Replacement Name will never become a Basionym because any a second recombination has to use the original epithet instead of the newly introduced epithet.


If indeed it is necessary to recognize a term that combines both Original Name and Replacement Name, I would suggest to use "Earliest Legitimate Name". The earliest legitimate name is a name that is effectively and validly published AND has no earlier homonym. It will most often be an original name but it may also be a replacement name of an original name that was a later homonym.


Below the relevant citations for protonym...


Dictionary of Fungi (9th edition, 2001, page 427): 

"...
Protonym (in nomenclature), a name effectively but not validly published after the starting point for the group.
..."

Donk, Persoonia 1: 175, (1960, page 175): 

"...
Protonym. Neither a devalidated nor validly published, though effectively published, name, taken up and validly published afterwards.
..."
and before, Donk, Persoonia 1: 175, (1960, page 174):
"...
Devalidated names are those names that would have been validly published if no later starting-points had been introduced.
..."



#NewCombinationDefinition
   <b>New&nbsp;combination</b>: A re-use of a previously-existing [[#ProtonymDefinition][Protonym]] (= [[#OriginalNameDefinition][Original Name]] or [[#ReplacementNameDefinition][Replacement Names]]) in a different nomenclatural context.  In the botany world these are thought of as discrete "names", separate from their [[#ProtonymDefinition][protonyms]]; but in Zoology they are usually thought of as merely different contextual usages of a pre-existing "name" ([[#ProtonymDefinition][protonym]]).  Although ICZN does not have any rules to determine which "revised contextual usages" of pre-existing [[#ProtonymDefinition][protonyms]] constitute an "official" New Combination, in most cases it will be more or less unambiguously determinable who first placed a pre-existing species epithet into a different nomenclatural context. In any case, New combinations ONLY in the context of a particular kind of usage that represents a subsequent use of a pre-existing [[#ProtonymDefinition][protonym]] in a novel nomenclatural context (e.g., the first placement of an existing species epithet into a different genus than the epithet was originally described in (i.e., the nomenclatural context of it's [[#ProtonymDefinition][Protonym]]). -- [[LCNewCombinationDiscussion][Discussion]]

---

#VariantSpellingDefinition
   <b>Variant&nbsp;spelling</b>: This term refers to variant spellings (i.e., slightly different [[#LCNameStringDiscussion][Name-strings]]) used for what is otherwise a pre-existing [[#ProtonymDefinition][Protonym]] or [[#NewCombinationDefinition][New Combination]].  These include intentional variations (e.g., alternate gender forms of Species-group epithets), as well as unintentional variations (i.e., [[#LapsusDefinition][Lapsus]]). Variant spellings exist ONLY in the context of a [[#NameUsageDefinition][Name-usage]]. -- [[LCVariantSpellingDiscussion][Discussion]]

#LapsusDefinition
   <b>Lapsus</b>: A particular kind of [[#VariantSpellingDefinition][Variant spelling]] that represents an unintentional alternate [[#NameStringDefinition][Name-string]] (e. g., typographical error). -- [[LCLapsusDiscussion][Discussion]]
 
#ReferenceDefinition
   <b>Reference</b>: Any form of DOCUMENTED date-stamped instance of one or more Authors (Agents).  This is broadly defined to include forms of documentation outside the context of [[#PublicationDefinition][Publications]]. "Documented" means that at least one physical (paper) or "permanent" electronic representation/facsimilie of information presented by Agent-Authors at a specific date/time is archived somewhere. Besides [[#PublicationDefinition][Publications]], these can include things like written personal communication (or archived representation of verbal personal communication), specimen labels, field notebooks, etc., etc. -- [[LCReferenceDiscussion][Discussion]]

#DocumentationDefinition
   <b>Documentation</b>: Synonym of the [[#ReferenceDefinition][Reference]] with less ambiguity; the word 'reference' is also used as relationship, just like the word 'name' can be used either name-string or name-object-relationship. -- Discussion on [[LCReferenceDiscussion][Reference]] and [[LCPublicationDiscussion][Publication]]

#PublicationDefinition
   <b>Publication</b>: A special subset of [[#ReferenceDefinition][References]] that have been "published" in some way (perhaps best to define "publication" in accordance with ICZN/ICBN rules governing publications????) -- [[LCPublicationDiscussion][Discussion]]

#UnpublishedDocumentationDefinition
   <b>Unpublished&nbsp;Documentation</b>: Permanently documented information (e.g. on paper, in digital format) that has not been published to a wider audience. This includes letters, laboratory or field books. It does not include forms of information attribution like "pers. comm.", which are not documented in any way.

These are some definitions proposed for use in further discussion.  Note that the word "name" is not on this list without some sort of qualification. We should all try to avoid using the word "name" without an explicit context. All definitions assume the scope of nomenclature defined for <nop>LinneanCore's domain, which is *tentatively* the Code-governed scientific names, plus possibly Trade Names, plus possibly some non-code-governed extensions of code-governed names [races, etc.], plus Linnean-type names used above the rank of Family (not technically governed by the Codes of Nomenclature -- at least not ICZN/ICBN.  Please feel free to comment/amend/etc., using the topics provided at the end of each definition. - 30 Oct 2004

#RankDefinition
	<b>Rank</b>: A specific, most-precise taxonomic rank (including intermediate ranks, such as "Subgenus", "Subspecies", etc.). See [[http://efgblade.cs.umb.edu/twiki/pub/UBIF/EnumerationTypes/UBIF-Docu-Enumerations.html#TaxonomicRankEnum][TaxonomicRankEum]]. -- [[TaxonomicRankDiscussion][Discussion]]

#RankGroupDefinition
	<b>Rank-group</b>: The "full" ranking groups. Within the context of Codes of nomenclature, these include only "Family-group", "Genus-group", and "Species-group".  However, we will also need to deal with "Order-group", "Class-group", "Phylum-group", and "Kingdom-group" entities as well. Although "Phylum-group" is Zoo-centric, "Division" is used for different [[#RankDefinition][ranks]] by different disciplines (even different sub-disciplines within Zoology), and "Phylum" is only used for one [[#RankDefinition][ranks]]. Therefore, it makes more sense to use "Phylum-group", "Phylum", "Subphylum", etc. -- and assume that these are all precisely synonymous with the botanical "Division" equivalencies. -- [[LCRankGroupDiscussion][Discussion]]

#NameDefinition
	<b>Name</b>: A relationship between a name-literal (and hence name-string) and a named-object.  It is recommeded to avoid this word as possible, but sometime inevitable.

#NameLiteralDefinition
	<b>Name-literal</b>: A literal word (or words) designating at least one object.  A single name-literal may designate multiple objects (homonymy) and multiple name-literals may designate single object (synonymy).  A name-literal is an abstraction of a set of [[#NameUsageDefinition][name-usages]].  A [[#NameStringDefinition][name-string]] is an electronic representation of a name-literal.  A name-literal may have [[#VariantSpellingDefinition][variant spellings]]; each variant is represented by a [[#NameStringDefinition][name-string]]. -- [[LCNameLiteralDiscussion][Discussion]]

#NameStringDefinition
	<b>Name-string</b>:  The Unicode string equivalent of [[#NameLiteralDefinition][name-literal]] printed on paper or represented in an electronic document to indicate a scientific name within the scope of <nop>LinneanCore's domain. It does *not* include authorship, but does include markup such as parentheses around infrageneric/supraspecific [[#NameUnitDefinition][Name-units]], and infraspecific rank terms (e.g., subsp., var., f. etc.). -- [[LCNameStringDiscussion][Discussion]]

#NameStringWithAuthorshipDefinition
	<b>Name-string&nbsp;with&nbsp;authorship</b>: A [[#NameStringDefinition][Name-string]] that includes the Code-appropriate authorships embedded within the [[#NameStringDefinition][name-string]]. -- [[LCNameStringDiscussionWithAuthorship][Discussion]]

#NameUnitDefinition
	<b>Name-unit</b>: A portion of a multi-part [[#NameStringDefinition][name-string]] that constitutes one discrete [[#RankDefinition][Rank]]. There do not appear to be any cases where a single name-unit would contain a space (" "), but it may include a hyphen ("-") or other characters outside the standard letters.  It is a token composing name-string, technically. -- [[LCNameUnitDiscussion][Discussion]]

#NameUsageDefinition
	<b>Name-usage</b>: The appearance of a [[#NameStringDefinition][Name-string]] within a [[#ReferenceDefinition][Reference]]. -- [[LCNameUsageDiscussion][Discussion]]

(Here some preliminary attempt by Gregor to clarify the Protonym/Basionym confusion, therefore for the moment not alphabetical:)

#BasionymDefinition
	<b>Basionym</b>: A role a name can have in relation to another name which is explicitly based upon the basionym name. Specifically, in genus or rank changing recombinations ("comb. nov.", "stat. nov.") the new name is based on a basionym name. The basionym of a name is always a [[#ProtonymDefinition][Protonym]] (= [[#OriginalNameDefinition][Original Name]] or [[#ReplacementNameDefinition][Replacement Name]]). The role of the basionym is very similar to the role of the [[#ReplacedSynonymDefinition][Replaced Synonym]] in the case of "nom. nov.". [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#BasionymDefinition][Basionym]] -->

#ReplacedSynonymDefinition
	<b>Replaced&nbsp;Synonym</b>: A role a name can have in relation to another name which is explicitly based upon the replaced synonym name. For example, if genus or rank changing recombinations would result in the creation of homonyms, a new epithet name has to be introduced to replace the previous epithet of the "Replaced Synonym". The replaced&nbsp;synonym of a name is always a [[#ProtonymDefinition][Protonym]] (= [[#OriginalNameDefinition][Original Name]] or [[#ReplacementNameDefinition][Replacement Name]]). This role is very close to a [[#BasionymDefinition][Basionym]], but ICBN (33.3) avoids the term basionym and uses this term instead. [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#ReplacedSynonymDefinition][Replaced Synonym]] -->

#ReplacementNameDefinition
	<b>Replacement&nbsp;Name</b>: A new name that replaces an existing name (= [[#ReplacedSynonymDefinition][Replaced Synonym]]). [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#ReplacementNameDefinition][Replacement Name]] -->


#OriginalNameDefinition
	<b>Original&nbsp;Name</b>: A name that introduces a new epithet and originally designates a type specimen (or other typification, including iconotype etc.). Multiple original names may accidentially based on the same type specimen. However, cases where a name is explicitly based to an older name (comb. nov,, stat. nov., nom. nov.) should not be considered original names. -- [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#OriginalNameDefinition][Original Name]] -->

#ProtonymDefinition
	<b>Protonym</b>: A name that introduced a new epithet the first time. This is the case in [[#OriginalNameDefinition][Original Names]] (not based on previously published nomenclatural names) and in the case of [[#ReplacementNameDefinition][Replacement Names]] (= "nom. nov.", = avowed substitute). -- [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#ProtonymDefinition][Protonym]] -->

#BasalNameDefinition
	<b>Basal&nbsp;Name</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>basonym</b>:  A role name for a name in a nomenclatural relationship, including [[#BasionymDefinition][Basionym]] and [[#ReplacedSynonymDefinition][Replaced Synonym]]. -- [[LCProtonymDiscussion][Discussion]] <!-- [[#BasalNameDefinition][Basal Name]] -->

#NewCombinationDefinition
	<b>New&nbsp;combination</b>: A re-use of a previously-existing [[#ProtonymDefinition][Protonym]] (= [[#OriginalNameDefinition][Original Name]] or [[#ReplacementNameDefinition][Replacement Names]]) in a different nomenclatural context.  In the botany world these are thought of as discrete "names", separate from their [[#ProtonymDefinition][protonyms]]; but in Zoology they are usually thought of as merely different contextual usages of a pre-existing "name" ([[#ProtonymDefinition][protonym]]).  Although ICZN does not have any rules to determine which "revised contextual usages" of pre-existing [[#ProtonymDefinition][protonyms]] constitute an "official" New Combination, in most cases it will be more or less unambiguously determinable who first placed a pre-existing species epithet into a different nomenclatural context.

#LapsusDefinition
	<b>Lapsus</b>: A particular kind of [[#VariantSpellingDefinition][Variant spelling]] that represents an unintentional alternate [[#NameStringDefinition][Name-string]] (e. g., typographical error). -- [[LCLapsusDiscussion][Discussion]]
 
#ReferenceDefinition

Also by Gregor another attempt to define the different kind of taxon concepts used in biological taxonomy

-- unfinished - will finish later need to save now! --

#TypeConceptDefinition
	<b>Type&nbsp;Concept</b>: Also called nomenclatural "name-object". This defines only a single point in nature and time, the type specimen. This kind of concept is the basis for the rules of nomenclature in bacteriology, botany, and zoology. It has little value when attempting to identify unknown organisms, but it serves as a fixing point to connect the circumscription concepts that are usually -- [[LCConceptConceptsDiscussion][Discussion]]

#CircumscriptionConceptDefinition
	<b>Circumscription&nbsp;Concept</b>: A concept defining an extension of observations in nature. The only concept used in identification. This kind of taxon concept is often loosely referred to as a "taxon concept" as opposed to a name -- [[LCConceptConceptsDiscussion][Discussion]]

#HierarchyConceptDefinition
	<b>Type&nbsp;Concept</b>: Perhaps call this enumerated concept instead? A tree of concepts based on other concepts. This has no value for identification. -- [[LCConceptConceptsDiscussion][Discussion]]

I realize that "Phylum-group" is Zoo-centric, but since "Division" is used for different Ranks by different disciplines (even different sub-disciplines within Zoology), and "Phylum" is only used for one rank, I propose that we use "Phylum-group", "Phylum", "Subphylum", etc. -- and assume that these are all precisely synonymous with the botanical "Division" equivalencies.

	* *Name-string*:  The Unicode equivalent of a literal string of text characters printed on paper or represented in an electronic document to indicate a scientific name within the scope of <nop>LinneanCore's domain. It does *not* include authorship, but does include markup such as parentheses around infrageneric/supraspecific *Name-Units*, and infraspecific prefixes (e.g., subsp., var., f. etc.). A Name-string DOES NOT EXIST outside the context of a *Name-usage*.
		* JMS: It would be better to use *Linnean name-string* for  <nop>LinneanCore specific name-string.  Do we need to restrict to ASCII/Unicode?  Do you have distinguish what printed on paper (glyph) and its electronic representation?  What do you mean by "context" here?  Nomenclatural correction can be made without correcting publication.  Do you include such machine-generated one as a *Name-usage*? -- 30 Oct 2004
		* Richard Pyle: My intention was for these definitions to exist only within the context of <nop>LinneanCore discussions, so "Linnean name-string" seems redundant. But if you want these definitions to have broader scope, then I suppose you could qualify it that way....but how would the definition of a "*Vernacular name-string*" (or other qualified name-string) differ from this definition?
			* JMS: I'd like to keep broder if possible, because we would need to say "such such is out of scope of <nop>LinneanCore; should be treated separetely (parhaps by TCS)" etc.  We'd better separate definition part, and <nop>LinneanCore specific part, e.g. " ...printed on paper or represented in an electronic document to designate a named object.  It is a scientific name within the scope of <nop>LinneanCore's domain." -- Oct 30 2004
			* (RP, cont.) I guess there is no need to specify "printed on paper or represented in an electronic document" -- I only added that bit to emphasize that the *Name-string* exists only in the context of a *Name-usage*. I mentioned "ASCII/Unicode" because I wanted to emphasize that the *Name-string* is the electronic representation of the *Name-string* (I've modified the definition to reflect this).  Are there other ways to electronically represent text strings besides ASCII/Unicode?  The reason for the restriction to electronic representation is that I assumed that LC data would always be represented electronically (at least at some point in its life).  The transliteration of printed scientific names into Unicode *Name-strings* is not perfect (even more problematic with ASCII), so the LC *Name-string* is specifically intended to mean the electronic version.
			* JMS: Again I prefer to broader defintion with restriction to <nop>LinneanCore.  TDWG-ish XML schema treates texts as UTF-8 generally, but it does not exclude to have name-strings on specimen label in a JPEG file.  How about " A literal string of text characters printed on paper or represented in an electronic document to desiganate a named-object.  It is a scientific name represented in UTF-8 within the scope of <nop>LinneanCore's domain." -- Oct 30 2004
				* Richard Pyle: I'm inclined to agree with all of your points, and change the definition accordingly.  However, I just want to establish clarity on one point.  In my mind, the word "string" in this context refers *specifically* to a sequence of electronically-rendered (ASCII/Unicode) characters. I do not think of a JPEG or bitmap rendering of a series of printed characters as a "string" composed of characters -- I think of these as images composed of pixels.  Thus, to me the "string* implies a standard computer-text (ASCII/Unicode) sequence of characters.  I think of the *Name-string* specifically as a schema element in LC (or TCS) that can be searched using text-comparison computer filter procedures.  So to me, the *Name-string* is not really a "name object", but an ASCII/Unicode (or UTF-8, if you prefer) <em>representation</em> of a name object.  In the case of electronic *References*, they are the same.  In the case of paper-printed *References*, there is an implied transliteration.  *HOWEVER*, I am willing to change my views on this and define a "Name-string" as a name object (as you suggest), and qualify that within the context of LC it implies a UTF-8 character string -- if you (or others) feel strongly about this. -- 30 Oct 2004
		* (RP, cont.) By "context", I was specifically trying to distinguish the *Name-string* as the literal text string represented in a taxonomic *Reference*, and *not* some sort of "corrected" nomenclatural representation that exists only within LC.  Perhaps we need a different definition for "*Code-compliant name-string*" to accomodate the machine-generated "corrected" strings?  The Machine-generated instance might be considered as a *Name-usage*, and therefore its corrected nomenclatural representation could be considered as a *Name-string*.  But the point is, it would be considered a *Name-string* only in the context of the machine-generated *Name-usage*; not in the context of the *Name-usage* of the source *Reference* Upon which the Machine name instance is based. -- 30 Oct 2004
		* Gregor: What do you mean by "Name-string exists only in the context of a Name-usage"? What does exist mean? The primary issue with names for me is their comparability. I want to know who else said something about the pathogen I believe I have. Thus I need to define equality rules for name-strings across name usage. In some respect this is what you do when you enter a name in Google etc. What is that string of unicode characters entered in Google that represents a scientific organism name? This is to me the essential item I would call a name string. No problem having another term for it - but give one. Name-string to me seems the obvious choice, rather than constraining name-string to string in name-usage context. -- 30. Oct. 2004
		* Gregor: I am rather confused why you limit Name-String to NOT include authors. In my practice I have no use for this term. A name-string without authors is an ambiguous in incomplete namestring. If I want to make conclusions based on name strings in printed or digital publications, I can use name-string with authors, or have to guess about the authors from geographical or historical context. To me the the Name-string-without-authors seems to be the special case. Is this botany against zoology? Or just Gregor :-) ? -- 30. Oct. 2004

		* Gregor: a multi-part *what*? Name-string? Name-string-with-authors? I think you mean words or terms in a name string, but I do not understand the definition. Do you mean "Aceraceae: Acer rubrum spp. rubrum L." has 6, 5, 4, or 3 units? In general, I propose to use "part" instead of unit: *Name-part*: A part of a multi-part Name-string-with-authors, delimited by whitespace, expcept in the case of authors where each name constitutes a part, and in the case of rank connecting terms composed of multiple words ("fm. spec."). What about the sensu suffixes? -- 30. Oct. 2004

		* Gregor: I think this does not work. The instance of the author of this text is sitting in front of the screen in Germany. It is not date-stamped. Honestly - I do not get what you try to express. I propose to add to publication "unpublished documentation" (letters, labbooks) and use this in the context, but I still do not get what you mean by the reference definition. Why is it not Reference: An attempt to make an unambiguous reference to a publication or unpublished documentation, optionally including a fragment identfier like a page number. A reference does not have to include publication date or authorship, provided the reference is unambiguous by other means (e.g. author plus volume number ("Sacc. XXII: 421"), or title that is unambiguous in the context ("Species plantarum, p. 30"). -- 30. Oct. 2004
a34 2
	* *Publication*:  A special subset of *References* that have been "published" in some way (perhaps best to define "publication" in accordance with ICZN/ICBN rules governing publications????)
