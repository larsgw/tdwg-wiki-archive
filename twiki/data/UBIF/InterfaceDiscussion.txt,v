One way to view the proxy model is to view them as interfaces to more complex data models. Whether a complex xml model exists (ABCD, TCS, SDD, etc.) or whether the interface design directly addresses relational databases (such as <nop>DarwinCore) is irrelevant in this context. I believe for the major knowledge domains (names, concepts, geography, literature/publication, agent, descriptions) we ultimately need <br/>
a) complex data models<br/>
b) data interface definitions.

Data interfaces should shield the complexity of a fuller model (i.e. the full model can be treated as a black box). They should be rough enough to fit to several models, but also detailed enough to allow the definition of proxy data (i.e. make a substantial semantic definition in cases where no external model is available, this is the idea of the proxy as a stand-in if no external data are available - which is the most common case now).

Data interface are often implicitly used in current practice. Specify uses a simplified literature and nomenclature interface. <nop>DwC contains name and geographical location interfaces. Napier Taxon Concept schema contains yet other interfaces for literature and specimen, and Linn.Core has yet another literature interface (and Jerry explicitly points to the need to agree on a common one, see the UBIF WIKI literature proxy page, http://wiki.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/UBIF/ProxyDataPublication).

I think the query/protocol question is a natural offspring of having a data interface. The interface by its very nature should be ideal for a simplified and general query protocol.

   * When you look at ProxyDataPublication -- are such diagrams a way to lead the discussions despite their technical nature? What would you do different?
   * Can we hold such a discussion on the WIKI?

In essence, data interface are used a lot. Specify uses a simplified literature and nomenclature interface. <nop>DwC contains name and geographical location interfaces. Napier Taxon Concept schema contains yet other interfaces for literature and specimen, and Linn.Core has yet another literature interface (and Jerry explicitly points to the need to agree on a common one, see the UBIF WIKI literature proxy page, http://efgblade.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/UBIF/ProxyDataPublication).

this discussion could fit into the UBIF space (Unified Biosciences Information Framework).

I think the discussion is a bit misleading if viewed under the aspect of extensibility (start simple, then extend). This is often not easily possible. However, there is another aspect: provide a simplified interface to various (and perhaps different) complex models for each knowledge domain.

When the full functionality is not needed, I often want to view the data that from my standpoint are "external" as a black box about which in 95% I do not care, but I need a relatively minimal interface.

I believe this interface is what we need for literature, geographical location, taxon name at least.

This is where I see DarwinCore (which essentially provides three interface - for
