<strong>Is it "Monomial" or "Mononomial"?</strong>

Gregor: According to Encycl. Brittanica: "monomials, which are the terms of the polynomial" - usage there however mathematical/logic.

Paul Kirk: The OED has "Monomial" = 'irregular form' and "Mononomial" = 'the more correct form' (with some suggestion that the irregular form came as a result of being 'slavishly copied from the french'). Thus my preference is for Mononomial. My colleague John David may have an opinion. I'm assuming the ICZN uses Monomial. Perhaps a question to Taxacom may stir up a 'hornets nest' of discussion ... My suspicion is that botanists use the word mononomial and zoologists monomial but I could be wrong.

Paul Kirk: we cannot find monomial in the ICZN - they use uninominal (uninomen) in addition to binomen and trinomen. As mononomial is a mixture of greek and latin whereas binomial is not I suggest we use uninomial, binomial, trinomial etc in our discussions - unless there is a strong tradition in zoology (outside the code) for monomial.

Richard Pyle: I do not believe there is a strong tradition in Zoology either way. - 09 Nov 2004

Gregor: I would prefer uninomial then. However, there is "hope" we may not need it in the schema (but still in the documentation). I believe in LCCanonicalNameDiscussion014: Proposal 2 it is redundant. Dince the full Text of the canonical name and the Monomial/Uninomial must by necessity be identical. So simply for all ranks of Genus and above, only the Text element would be used. The only drawback would that this does not allow to specify a regular expression pattern enforcing the uninomial to be indeed uninomial, i.e. contain no blank or other whitespace. Any ideas on this? - 09 Nov 2004
