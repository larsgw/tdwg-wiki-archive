Authorship should be normalized as much as possible. However, some redundant authorship information (like authors before "ex" and after "in") are welcome to be able to generate full name-string (with author) variants. *Description of the type in the xml schema:* "The authorship and publication details (including the year on publication, the true date of publication, and the "in"-part of a citation)."

Fundamental issues about what sort of authorship information LC needs to track, and where it differs (by convention or by Code) between botany/zoology/bacterial/viral/cultivar domains is discussed under LCNameAuthorshipConventions. -- Richard Pyle - 09 Nov 2004
