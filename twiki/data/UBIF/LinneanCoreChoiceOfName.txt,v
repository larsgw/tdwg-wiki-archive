%META:TOPICPARENT{name="LinneanCore"}%
The originally proposed name by Jerry Cooper with his initial proposal was <nop>LinnaeanCore. Karen Wilson proposed to simplify the spelling to <nop>LinneanCore, under which name it was discussed in Christchurch. Richard Pyle proposes to change it to <nop>LinneausCore, to use the same pattern as in <nop>DarwinCore

Votes: 

1. Change to <nop>LinneausCore

Richard Pyle: "I think it should be "LinnaeusCore", rather than "LinnaeanCore" (or whatever spelling variant of the adjective form is correct).  I know this is trivial and nit-picky, but unless anyone objects, I'll henceforth refer to it this way (to maintain consistency with the Darwin & Gutenberg equivalents).

2. Keep <nop>LinneanCore

Gregor Hagedorn: Until a few weeks ago I thought "<nop>DarwinCore" uses the pattern of <nop>DublinCore, i. e. it went back to a meeting in the city of Darwin, and used because this is such a fitting coincidence. This is a myth as I found out, but it shows that <nop>DarwinCore may not be the best precendent - although I have no intention of changing it and think it sounds great. I guess in my feeling the genitive Linnean simply sounds better and more appropriate."

Chris Lyal: "I happen to prefer <nop>LinneanCore, because as a taxonomist I am committed to stability in nomenclature, because it is already referred to as such in a number of documents (try it on Google) (although I admit the synonym <nop>LinnaeanCore) - and '<nop>LinnaeusCore' invites confusion with the software developed by ETI and I'd like to avoid this.  However, Jerry holds IPR,
I guess."

James Ytow: "I only followed spelling of the Linnean Society of London."  Isn't it a schema to exhange Linnean name strings?

Sally Hinchcliffe: "I also think we should keep Linnean Core - it doesn't really make sense, but it sounds better (Darwin and Dublin both also end in 'n')"

Richard Pyle: "I concede to the masses -- so unless there are any objections, I think we should stick with <nop>LinneanCore and close this topic."
