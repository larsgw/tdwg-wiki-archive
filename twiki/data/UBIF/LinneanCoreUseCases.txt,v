My use case scenarios where I see LinneanCore to be used are

a) Form the scientific name representation of future taxon concept exchange standards. Especially, in regard to TCS it should replace the ABCD-style name details used in TCS 0.80. This is based on an older version of ABCD (1.20?) and completely separates name data elements for Bacterial, Botanical, Zoological and Viral names. This separation may simplify the task of exporting names for those having names only of one major taxonomic groups, but any consumer dealing with several of Bacterial, Botanical, Zoological and Viral names either has to work against a super-wide structure, often using complex OR-queries to find a given name, or has to figure out the relationships between the different subtypes for names him- or herself. It is clear that some names specialities are limited to one area, but I believe these should be modeled as extensions from a common name-detail-supertype applicable to all kind of scientific names (perhaps with the exception of viral names?). 

To avoid waiting for TCS to be finished, I believe it is very acceptable to agree on a first version of LinneanCore quick, accepting the danger that together with TCS a modified version 2 of LC may have to appear. I do believe that Jessie Kennedy's arguments that standards that model current biological practices detracts from the power of introducing entirely new procedures into biology is not correct. Indead, LinneanCore may be the easy way for those not able or willing to deal with the problems in making taxon concepts explicit. However, I do believe that users of LinneanCore may find it easier to later upgrade to a TCS-style model. LC may pave a way to more complex and sophisticated models.

For these reasons, I believe that a major design goal of LC should be to be as intuitive to biologists as possible.

b) Separate the issues of conveying hierarchical information from a standardized "canonical name" name used for comparing name equality. See the separate issue LinneanCoreDisentangle
