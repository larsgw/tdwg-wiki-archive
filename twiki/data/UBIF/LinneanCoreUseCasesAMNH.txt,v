Our project here at AMNH is dealing with the marking up legacy taxonomic literature (AMNH Novitates) - We've been analyzing all the various schema players out there, SDD, !TaxonX, !TaxMLit etc. as well as rewriting !TaxonX to import !LinneanCore to use as its nomenclature section.

please check out our project website for more information and examples. 

<a target="_new" href="http://research.amnh.org/informatics/taxlit">Project Website</a>

As well as the wiki, which describes some of the problems/rewrites that were needed to successfully import !LinnaenCore into !TaxonX

<a target="_new" href="http://wiki.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/Ants/TaxonXAndLinneanCore">Wiki discussion on the importing of !LinnaeanCore into !TaxonX</a>

I would greatly appreciate comments and questions.
