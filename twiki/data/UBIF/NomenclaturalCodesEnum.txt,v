This is very rough, improved documentation will follow as soon as some feedback on this arrived. The values attempt to follow ABCD over Jerry's LC usage, since providers already use ABCD codes and no real argument against using English names over using the abbreviations so far was made. This enumeration was newly added to UBIF in Christchurch in a discussion between Gregor and Jerry.

*NomenclaturalCodesEnum*: Enumeration of the nomenclatural code under which a name is considered valid. (Source: comparison of enumerations in ABCD 1.49 and initial LinneanCore.)
   * Viral
   * Bacteriological
   * Botanical: International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, ICBN
   * Zoological: International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, ICZN
   * <nop>CultivatedPlant: Code of cultivated plants
   * Indeterminate: Examples: ambiregnally named taxa can not be fixed to a code; to express the (pre-starting point) names on which the sanctioning mechanism of fungal names is based.

Questions: Any missing codes? Does Linnean Core need an extra attribute for version of a code, or should the version even be embedded in the enumerated values?
