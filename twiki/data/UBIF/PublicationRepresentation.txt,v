Consider the Library of Congress Metadata Object Schema ([[http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/][mods]]) for the description of publications. It is, I am told, widely used in the digital library world, and there is apparently a lot(?) of software that extracts publication in mods format directly from library catalogs. It is conceivable that this makes it better than an a specially defined UBIF definition of publication descriptions.

I did look at it and it is being discussed on ProxyDataPublication and ProxyDataPublicationMODS. I personally have been utterly unable to understand how to use MODS for a simple things like citing an article in a journal. I guess it can do that, but it seems not really to be designed for it (rather for library objects with rich metadata, cataloguing, classification, all of which is not really relevant in scientific publication citing).

As said on the cited pages, MODS is an alternative, but someone would have to sit down and explain how to use it. Also it is pretty huge, perhaps a factor of 50 larger than the AlexandriaCore proposal...

Actually, I convinced myself that the "type" attribute duplication fault in the schema is not a fault but a namespace botch in XMLSpy, still there in Spy2005 SP2. Also, that version of Spy does show attributes in the diagrams in a quire reasonable way. 

I'm not sure about the complaint about size. I believe neither xs:import nor xs:include actually impose any requirement to physically include anything in the containing schema, so the only issue is whether one thinks it is too big to master. But all the elements are global, so if it turns out to be convenient to only use a few of them, one would only have to study a few.

Certainly, with size I only refer to the effort required by adapters to map their local data to such a complex and truly difficult to understand schema. And the effort by people writing software in making sure they are able to import all the data.

Unfortunately, when exchanging scientific data, I still believe it is important to get the full semantics, or drop only things you have analyzed as being irrelevant to your purpose. That is where I personally feel a microMODS may be needed.
