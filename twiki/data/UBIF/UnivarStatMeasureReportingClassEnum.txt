Broad classification of the univariate statistical methods, used in "UnivariateStatisticalMeasureEnum": //xs:enumeration/xs:annotation/xs:appinfo/Specification/ReportingClass. A separate xslt script (UBIF_Enumerations.xsl, see the UBIF-EnumerationTools.zip file distributed together with the UBIF schema package) is provided that converts this from schema data to xml instance data. <nop>ReportingClasses are provided to simplify the creation of applications using <nop>UnivariateStatisticalMeasure values. They simplify the detailed information provided by the method values into a minimally extended version of the five basic measurement classes supported by DELTA. Most applications that report information for human consumption can rely on these reporting classes in their decision how to present the data. Whereas <nop>UnivariateStatisticalMeasureEnum must be implemented, these additional specifications are an offer to simplify implementations and increase compatibility with future UBIF version. Implementors may choose different methods of handling the statistical measures, however. Compare also UnivarStatMeasureMethodClassEnum.
