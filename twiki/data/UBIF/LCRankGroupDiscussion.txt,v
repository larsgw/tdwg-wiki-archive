	* Gregor: For <nop>RankGroup I wonder why you discuss this term. I think since it can be derived from knowledge of the rank, it is not necessary in LC - do you disagree? 
		* Richard: Perhaps, but again I just wanted an unambiguous vocabulary.  The idea of <nop>RankGroup will factor in on discussions related to Code rules.  I think it will be useful in this context to have a term "RankGroup" as a way of expressing a set of ranks with similar Code requirements, separate from the specific *Ranks*. - 30 Oct 2004 HST
