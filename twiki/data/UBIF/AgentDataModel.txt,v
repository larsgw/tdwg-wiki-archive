The agent proxy type in SDD was up to 0.9 simply a place holder, based on the proxy base type and extended only with exemplary elements to indicate the a specific extension would be desirable. However, we never invested real modeling effort into it. ABCD (ca. version 1.44) provides an elaborate and well thought out <nop>ContactType that has no support to link to external agent databases. Under the assumption that we will agree on a common data infrastructure, the <nop>ABCD.ContactType should be integrated with the general ObsoleteTopicObsoleteTopicProxyDataModel to form a revised <nop>AgentProxy type.

I propose a model that is partly based on vCard 3.0 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2426.txt). vCard does not provide for some extensions (we may have deceased agents where death date is relevant, the organisations have no abbreviations/acronyms, and the personal names have a strong American bias, that works well with many European cultures, but not necessarily internationally (a most interesting document in this respect is http://dublincore.org/documents/1998/02/03/name-representation/).

Nevertheless, vCard seems to be a likely upcoming source for external Agent data. XML-vCard exists either in the variant used in the Jabber community, see http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0054.html, or embedded in RDF, see e.g. http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/03/31/qa.html (note: the commercial <nop>GoldMine schema mentioned there is useless for our purposes). Another option may be the friend-of-a-friend projects (see http://rdfweb.org/topic/FAQ) which start to provide a standard-trail like document: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/. FOAF is very semantic web and RDF-oriented.

See also: "URLs for Telephone Calls. A. Vaha-Sipila, Internet RFC 2806 issued 2000-04" (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2806.txt) and "Markup Languages for Names and Addresses" (http://xml.coverpages.org/namesAndAddresses.html).

Can anybody give advice on what to do here? The issue would be to define a moderately simple but expressive schema, that is relatively easy to implement for stand-alone use (i.e. in the absence of truly external Agent databases), but which allows to define interfaces where such external databases exist.
