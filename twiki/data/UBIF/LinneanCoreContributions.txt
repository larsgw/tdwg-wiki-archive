Because so many people contributed to the LinneanCore discussion off-line through email input, or through personal discussions - before I loose track of the contributions I am aware of, here is a list of people who invested time in making LinneanCore happen. Please note that as of this writing (10.12.2004) this may be rather incomplete, please add where appropriate:
