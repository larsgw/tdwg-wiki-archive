---++GISIN Terminology Working Group Summary
Thursday, February 23, 2006

The issue of use of the terms in the Status and Invasiveness Elements (e.g. alien, native, invasive, non-invasive etc) has been addressed. The Terminology Working Group agrees to implement the Definition framework proposed by Kevin Thiele that must be used by data providers to define what they mean when they use these terms. Terms within the definition framework need some final review before implementation. Reference document (Kevin Thiele) name: GISINdefinitionsMatrix

---+++Additional terms for elements: 

-  See Excel spreadsheet attachment (here below) for comments added in each Element column. Almost all Elements need further review with respect to suggestions by Emery and the Terminology working group.

-  Emery has submitted additional terms for consideration in the following elements: Realm; Habitat Lookup; Lifeform Lookup; Location Type Heirarchy; Occurrence; Impact Type; Impact Mechanism; Impact Outcome; Introduction Types; Introduction Cause; Introduction Vector Types; Dispersal Types; Cause of Dispersal; Dispersal Vector Types. We have briefly reviewed these, but more study is needed. Recommendations for additions/modifications to these elements based on Emery's suggestions will be developed by the Terminology Working Group at a future meeting/date. See spreadsheet with Emery's suggestions in red attached here below.

-  Recommendations from the plenary: Zalba's comments addressed; Thiele's comments RE Lifeform element addressed; Emery comments RE filtering of sensitive records is provider drive/responsibility; Emery comment RE specific description of habitat (e.g. 'on carrots') addressed by 'Notes' (free text field) in schema associated with each element, including Habitat; RE web-sourced comment RE LifeForm mixture of taxonomic/form terms (esp. for plants) needs to be addressed in future discussion.
