---++Definition Framework matrix (proposed by Kevin Thiele)

*Proposal* - we will provide a picklist of a large number of terms that people use in various databases to describe alien invasives (a shortlist is in *Table A*). These terms will include some we don't like, and the terms will not be mutually exclusive. However, we will also provide a more atomised set of terms using which providers must define what they mean by the terms they use. The term-defining concepts and terms are in *Table B* below. See also SampleDefinitions.

*Table A*

| Some terms used in databases |	
|Alien	|Invasive		|Non-Invasive|
|Introduced | | |			
|Native | | |			
|Exotic | | |			
|Cryptogenic | | |		
|adventive | | |		
|feral | | |	
|foreign | | |	
|naturalised | | |
