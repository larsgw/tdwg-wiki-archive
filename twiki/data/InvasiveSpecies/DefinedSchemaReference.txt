@@@ Main.BobMorris would like some explicit examples of these fields, preferably in the context of an example of a DefinedSchema

Sergio Zalba uses the following lookup of 'Dispersal' terms in Portuguese:
Anemocórica
Autocórica
Blastocórica
Entomocórica
Ornitocórica
Quirocórica
Zoocórica
Barocórica
Hidrocórica
Indeterminada
It is not published (as far as I know), but if it was published, he would complete the referencing data for his 'Dispersal' schema (i.e.  DefinedSchemaName, DefinedSchemaValue, DefinedSchemaReference).
