<b>The Impacts element is a TaxonData/[[Facts]] sub-element. It contains [[Type]], [[Outcome]], [[Mechanism]], [[Interactions]], [[Degree]] and ProjectOrCaseStudy sub-elements. The [[Type]] element contains [[Environmental]], HumanHealth, EconomicLivelihood and CulturalAmenity sub-elements, and the [[Environmental]] sub-element contains EcosystemProcesses, CommunityStructure, CommunityComposition and TaxonImpacted sub-elements. The TaxonImpacted element contains a [[Taxon]] sub-element, which has the same components as the global TaxonomicType element, and a ConservationSignificance sub-element. The [[Interactions]] element contains InteractsWithTaxon, [[LifeStage]], [[Symptom]], [[Part]] and [[Status]] sub-elements, and the InteractsWithTaxon element has the same components as the global TaxonomicType element.
