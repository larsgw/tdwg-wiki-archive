<b>The GeneralFacts element is a TaxonData/[[Facts]] sub-element. [[Facts]] can be identified either as either GeneralFacts or LocationSpecificFacts. By choosing GeneralFacts, the user can add general information about typical [[Introduction]] and [[Dispersal]] mechanisms, but if this information is location-specific, he/she must choose LocationSpecificFacts. In the current version of the IAS-PS, the only way to record some facts as GeneralFacts and others as LocationSpecificFacts is to make two separate ‘[[Fact]]’ entries. The community could usefully explore the costs and benefits of making this option more widely available at a lower level to cope with “mixed-content fact sheets”. <b>-- Michael.Browne
