<b>The PopulationDynamics element is a LocationSpecificlFacts/[[Biostatus]] sub-element. It is not enumerated in this version of the IAS-PS but it would support information such as “stable/expanding” or “numerous/few”, direction of expansion, rate of expansion (“rapid” or “gradual”), size of specimens collected, population growth rate, population age, and initial/current population size.<b>-- Michael.Browne
