<b>The Invasiveness element is a LocationSpecificlFacts/Biostatus sub-element. It has a DefinedSchema element so that users can record the definition of ‘invasive’ that they are using, or they can reference the classification schema they are using; e.g. when they use terms such as ‘potentially invasive, moderately invasive and highly invasive’.<b>-- Michael.Browne
