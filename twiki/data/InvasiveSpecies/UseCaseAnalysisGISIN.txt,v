<h1>Taxonomic Database Working Group</h1>

<h4>Version: 1.2 -- UseCaseAnalysisGISIN; also see UserScenariosAndUseCases</h4>
<h4>Last  Update: 7th of November, 2006</h4>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document takes the use cases, described in the Use  Cases document, and describes how they will be implemented.&nbsp; The end result is a list of operational modes  that are part of the requirements for the specification.</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h3>1. Is your network going to evaluate different technologies  to manage the various exotic plants? Basically, how well can we actually manage  any of these exotics?</h3>
<p>- There are existing web sites that provide management  information including a global management project register where details of  techniques, costs, etc. will be available. (www.issg.org/database).&nbsp; In the future we will be sharing profiles and  case studies that include management information.</p>

<h3>2. Scientist wishes to estimate rate of expansion of new  invader based on global occurrence data.</h3>
<p>a. Goes to a GISIN web site for modeling</p>
  b. Searches for the desired species<br />
  c. Requests a model of the species if it invaded New    Zealand</p>
<p>i. GISIN enabled web site searches across all available  servers for all occurrence data for the species.<br />
  ii. Site queries available environmental servers for  matching environmental data (with something like WMS)<br />
  iii. Site maps predicted potential distribution onto New    Zealand based on areas that match  environmental data of existing occurrences.</p>

<h3>3. Where in the world is phoenix palm listed as invasive?</h3>
<p>- Query GINIS provider for locations where phoenix palm is  described as invasive</p>
<h4>3.1 How invasive is it in those places?</h4>
<p>- Query GINIS providers for locations and invasiveness  (BioStatus.Invasiveness) where phoenix palm is described as invasive<br />
  - Link the user to original web site for more information</p>

<h3>4. What are the southern most places where phoenix palm was  been described as invasive?</h3>
<p>Use the same operation as 3.1 and then obtain the locations  of each entry and sort them by latitude.&nbsp;  Locations without available spatial data have to be flagged as such for  the user.&nbsp; While this is non-optimal for  the user this is seen as a secondary usage (derived).</p>

<h3>5. Two local governments in South-east Queensland  Australia, have  discovered a species not previously recorded in the state (or country)  -Dyschoriste depressa - a native of South Africa.  It is apparent that once it establishes in waterways (it's preferred habitat in  its country of origin) it is very difficult to treat. They are contemplating  undertaking an eradication program but they need to find out the average seed  longevity and germination rate for the species. GISIN allows a search of  botanists/ecologists in South Africa  to contact.</h3>
<p>- Search for profiles of Dyschoriste depressa, this will  also contain cites for literature for further study.<br />
  - Support the Delivering Alien Invasive Species for Europe  (DAISIE) as a resource for locations of experts<br />
  - In the future, the user could search for case studies for  this species.</p>

<h3>6. GISIN allows a species based search that shows experts in  the treatment of that species</h3>
<p>- Send them to the DAISIE register of experts</p>

<h3>7. A reviewer looks up GISIN to check if the scientific  (Linnaean) name of an invasive species listed in a 15 year old publication is  the correct contemporary name, or a synonym / subordinate name</h3>
<p>- Direct them to a name resolving service such as ECAT,  ITIS, TROPICOS, Species 2000 etc.</p>

<h3>8. A reserve manager requests GISIN to list any reported  habitat preference/s for species X in its native region.</h3>
<p>Option 1: Information directly from BioStatus<br />
  - Query all locations and habitat information where the  species is native <br />
  - Examine Habitat information</p>
<p>Option 2: Use occurrences to derive niche information with  environmental data from other services<br />
  - Query all occurrence locations where the species is native <br />
  - Obtain spatial data/coordinates for the locations<br />
  - Add environmental information from other services based on  coordinates (DEMs from JPL)<br />
  - Build a niche model</p>
<p>Option 3: Use occurrences to derive niche information from  GISIN information<br />
  - Query all occurrence locations (inc. spatial data), and  ancillary data, where the species is native </p>
<p>Option 4:<br />
  - In the near future, Profiles from all GISIN providers. </p>
<h4>8.1&nbsp; Case 8 in its  invaded location/s</h4>
<p>Do the options above with non-native instead of native</p>

<h3>9. A risk assessor looks up GISIN to find if any  environmental temperature and salinity tolerance data has been reported for  species Y, a suspected brackish water invader</h3>
<p>- request same as 8 without biostatus limitation, but limit  habitat preference to specific parameters (temperature and salinity tolerance)<br />
  -return values for temperature and for salinity tolerance OR  return null</p>

<h3>10. Traditionally in Canada,  the disposal options for infected plant material are either deep burial or  incineration. With large amounts of plant material needing disposal in some  cases, are other disposal options available?</h3>
<p>- In the future, Query all profiles in the kingdom Plantae  with the keyword &ldquo;disposal&rdquo; within the management section<br />
  - See the DASIE site for a list of experts</p>

<h3>11. With the discovery of Sirex noctilio in North   America, what control options are available?</h3>
<p>- In the future, Query the management section all profiles  for the species Sirex noctilio <br />
  - See the DASIE site for a list of experts</p>

<h3>12. &quot;For non native plant or animal species X:</h3>
<h4>12.1 What is it? ID information and distinguishing it from  other species (keys or references to keys) and links to flora or fauna  references with the species description. </h4>
<p>- Refer folks to taxonomic keys?</p>

<h4>12.2 Where is it? </p>
<p>- Get an occurrence list for the species<br />
  - Get a distribution list of the species</p>

<h4>12.2.1 Where it is native? </h4>
<p>- Query Distribution Record location for species where  biostatus is native</p>

<h4>12.2.2 Where it is naturalized or invasive? </h4>
<p>- Query Distribution Record location for species where  biostatus is naturalized or invasive</p>

<h4>12.2.3 Is it problematic in its native range? </h4>
<p>- Query Distribution Record location for species where  biostatus is native and problematic</p>

<h4>12.2.4 Distinguish between problems in the more natural and  versus human modified ecosystems.</h4>
<p>Option 1:<br />
  - Get occurance data for the species<br />
  - Correlate with data from other systems</p>
<p>Option 2:<br />
  - Get Distribution Records.Impacts for the species</p>

<h4>12.3 How do you kill it? Control methods, including successful  and unsuccessful biocontrol.</h4>
<p>- In the near future, get the management data for the  profiles for the species</p>

<h4>12.4 Pathways to introduction or mechanisms of spread. E.g.  bird dispersed, wind dispersed, parasite etc</h4>
<p>- Query the Distribution Records Introduction and Dispersal  fields for the species</p>

<h4>12.4.1 Laws</h4>
<p>- Web sites may have links to laws for countries.&nbsp; &nbsp;Typically  available as a review of policy (e.g. import standards for wood packaging  material) related to invasive species.&nbsp;  Distribution Records may have legal status (e.g. prohibited, noxious) in  their ancillary data.</p>

<h4>12.4.2 Published articles</h4>
<p>- Refer to other web sites.&nbsp;  In the near future, may be included in profiles.&nbsp; In the future, look to TDWG efforts to expose  literature to machine queries.</p>
<p>12.3.3 Controls including herbicides and pesticides </p>
<p>- In the near future, get the management data for the  profiles for the species</p>

<h3>13. During a rapid assessment in a protected area in Belize,  some grasses are found that may be invasive species. It proves impossible to  identify them with the botanical keys at hand and there is no time and/or money  to send specimens to a specialist abroad. The GISIN network should contain keys  and pictures to assist in the identification and verification of these species.</h3>
<p>- Provide links to existing keys on the GISIN web site, in  the future we may do something else.</p>

<h3>14. What is the change of distribution range of invasive  species X in country/area Y?</h3>
<p>- Query the list of occurrence locations and dates of the species  in the country/area<br />
  - Sort by date<br />
  - Put up a really cool animation</p>

<h3>15. Let us imagine that there is a pair of species A and B,  which look very similar. One of them is invasive alien species and the other is  a 'normal', harmless one. It might be useful to have some help in the Internet  how to recognize these two easily. You suggested that the species experts could  be found but in some cases it might be possible to put the necessary  determining tools, plus photos, drawings etc in the net (plus the name of the  expert(s), who made the determining tool in th</h3>
<p>- Provide links to existing keys on the GISIN web site, in  the future we may do something else.<br />
  - Provide links to experts databases (DAISIE)<br />
  - Query similar species from profiles on species A and B</p>

<h2>New Use Cases</h2>

<h3>1. Get any records that have abundance information.</h3>
  - spatial extent<br />
  - spatial density<br />

<h3>2. What are the southern most places in New    Zealand where phoenix palm was been  described as invasive?</h3>
<p>- Query as in 3.1 but with a filter that the locations are  in New Zealand?<br />
  &nbsp; - Problem:  There is a national park in New Zealand  listed as having the palm but we don&rsquo;t have spatial data for the park.</p>

<h3>3. Get all available literature on an invasive earth worm  species?</h3>
<p>Option 1:<br />
  - Query Web of science with keywords for the species and the  word &ldquo;invasive&rdquo;</p>
<p>Option 2:<br />
  - Query all citations from distribution records for the  species where the biostatus is invasive</p>
