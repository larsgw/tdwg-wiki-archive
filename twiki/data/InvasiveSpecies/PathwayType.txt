<b>The PathwayType element is a LocationSpecificlFacts/Biostatus sub-element. It can be used for either [[Introduction]] or [[Dispersal]]. Users can decide which element is more appropriate depending on the political and spatial context of their data. [[Introduction]] information is usually the focus of preventative biosecurity measures whereas [[Dispersal]] information is more often the focus of management measures. The [[Introduction]] and [[Dispersal]] elements contain [[Date]], [[Vector]], [[Cause]], [[Route]], [[Type]] (e.g. intentional or unintentional), InitialPopulationSize and ProjectOrCaseStudy elements.

The [[Cause]], [[Route]] and [[Vector]] structure came from Carlton and Ruiz (2003). ‘[[Cause]]’ is why a species is transported, whether accidentally or deliberately, ‘[[Vector]]’ is how a species is transported, that is, the physical means or agent, and ‘[[Route]]’ is the geographic path over which a species is transported from the origin (donor area) to the destination (target area).  The [[Route]] element contains [[To]], [[From]], [[Corridor]], and [[Distance]] sub-elements. 

The PathwayType element might be further improved with the inclusion of 3 other elements identified by Carlton and Ruiz (2003). They are VectorTempo; i.e. how a given vector operates through time, in terms of size and rate, speed, and timing, VectorBiota; i.e. description of the biota (the propagules) transferred by a given vector, in terms of diversity, density, and condition, and VectorStrength; the relative number or rate of established invasions that result within a specified time period from a given vector in a particular geographic region.
