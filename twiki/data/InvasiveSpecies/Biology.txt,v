It contains sub-elements for Reproduction (with 5 sub-elements; [[Temperature]], [[Cues]], [[Salinity]], StrategyOrSystem, FecundityOrOutput), [[Nutrition]], LifeCycle, TrophicLevel and UndesirableCharacteristics. The UndesirableCharacteristics element might include statements about persistence or time known in that location, capacity to establish and spread or to secure and ingest a wide range of food, tolerance of physical conditions, pioneering capacity in disturbed or vacant habitats, etc.<b>-- Michael.Browne
