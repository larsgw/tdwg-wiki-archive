2006-02-23 - Day 3 - AM results

---+++Recommendations indexed by priority number


*7. Doc Exchange*

TAPIR Recommended


*8. Integrity / Extension*

BM: List of concerns:

- Make schema smaller ==> BM

- Enumeration (Lists)


*15. Extensibility*

Build/manage list

How to update lists without having to change the schema

Not standardized with XML schema?

Bob will investigate


MD: Versioning

Version attribute used during processing

BM: Other option (with extension capabilities)


Extensibility options

- Change internal schema version

- Schema version attribute on root element

- Change target namespace


Maybe other solutions


MD: Recommend to have a closer look at how to link to external ontologies


*10. Exclusion / Optional element*

If mandatory ==> not valid if empty


*11. Synonyms*

Get list of synonyms

Build associations to resolve names

BM/MD: Support standards for nomenclature and taxon concepts


*13. Update / Data Quality*

MD: Done through annotations

No generic system


*14. Data Use / Ownership*

Eventually, GBIF will have to tackle this problem 

of harmonizing metadata.


Metadata - Dataset

BM: may need ID/IDREF

Then efficiency question

Inherited metadata


When data from different providers is aggregated

we should have a mechanism to keep track of who provided what

==> envelope element


Try to combine several envelopes within the same XML document


*17. Strong Typing*

Bob's Homework

Define every structured item

Need a data type for every element/attribute with content

Consider adding pattern (regex) facets for strings that need parsing


*18. Doc Instance / Integrity*

Use XML Validation tools

Use Xerces 


*19. Doc Size*

BM: No merit

MD: Compression available

(server will use it if the client supports it)
