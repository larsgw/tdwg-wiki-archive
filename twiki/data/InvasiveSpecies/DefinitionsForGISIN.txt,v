<h1>GISIN: Definitions Document</h1>
<h4>Version: 2.0 -- DefinitionsForGISIN</h4>
<h4>Last  Update: 15th of February, 2007</h4>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document defines the terms that are used throughout the  Invasive Species System.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>1. Common Terms</h2>

<h3>1.1 End-user</h3>
<p>A person who is using a computer to access data on invasive  species for their personal use.&nbsp;  End-users include those browsing the web for information as well as  scientists accessing the Internet to obtain information for analysis.&nbsp; End-users typically use a web-browser to  access the data but may use a protocol to download information using a web  crawler.&nbsp; End-users does not include  those enabling web services to exchange data with other computers in a general  fashion.</p>

<h3>1.2 Invasive Species</h3>
<p>A species, genus, subspecies, or variety, that is not native  to a given area and is considered harmful to humans, economic concerns, or  native ecosystems.</p>
<h3>1.3 Protocol</h3>
<p>A defined grammar and syntax that allows two computers to  control the exchange of a particular type of data.</p>
<h3>1.4 Cyberinfrastruture</h3>
<p>A group of computers that can communicate between one  another to provide a higher level of functionality for end-users that if they  were operating individually.</p>
<h3>1.5 Provider</h3>
<p>An individual or organization that has possession of data on  invasive species and wishes to make it available to others through the  Internet.&nbsp; Also, a computer that contains  such data and has made it available to other computers through a web service.</p>
<h3>1.6 Consumers</h3>
<p>An individual or organization that wishes to access that is  held by others for purposes such as mapping, modeling, and statistical  analysis.&nbsp; Also, a computer that requests  data from another computer.</p>
<h3>1.7 Data Common</h3>
<p>A provider that also allows end-users to add data to their  database, their by making it available on the Internet.</p>
<h3>1.8 Portals</h3>
<p>A portal is a web site who&rsquo;s primary purpose is to provide  access to different web services provided in the Invasive Species System.</p>

<h2>2. Simple Types of data</h2>

<h3>2.1 Location</h3>
<p>Location refers to a unique place on the earth and can be a  country, state, province, or other area.&nbsp;  A location can be identified by a location type and a standard location  code or by geographic coordinates.&nbsp; An  example of a location type and code would be a country paired with a standard  United Nations country code (cite).&nbsp;&nbsp;  Geographic coordinates can be used to describe locations as points, a  series of line segments (for streams and roads), or as polygons.</p>
<h3>2.2 Date</h3>
<p>A date is defined as an ISO standard date and includes at  least a year but can also have a month, day, hour, and minute.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>2.3 Taxon </h3>
<p>A Taxon defines a particular location in a taxonomic  hierarchy.&nbsp; A taxon can be a kingdom,  phylum/division, class, order, family, genus, species, sub species, or variety. </p>
<p>Note: The plural of Taxon is a Taxa which is a number of  points in a taxonomic hierarchy, one example of a taxa is a species list.</p>
<h3>2.4 Scientific Name</h3>
<p>A taxon that contains at least a Genus and can also include  species, subspecies, and variety.</p>
<h3>2.5 BioStatus</h3>
<p>BioStatus defines the status of a particular taxon to a  particular location.&nbsp; BioStatus includes  the following classifications:</p>
<p>Example:<br />
   - In the  state of New Mexico, Tamarix is:<br />
   Origin:  Alien<br />
   Introduced:  Yes<br />
   Harmful:  Yes<br />
   Noxious:  No<br />
   Present:  Yes</p>
<p>Note: the details of the BioStatus data is current being  defined</p>

<h2>3. Aggregate Data  Types</h2>
<p>The following data types include some number of the data  types defined in section 1.</p>
<h3>3.1 Occurrence</h3>
<p>Occurrence is the identification that a particular organism  or organisms, identified by a taxon, where in a particular location on a specific  date.&nbsp; Occurrence is used as a synonym for  the terms; specimen, observation, survey, etc.&nbsp;  In the documents for the protocol, only occurrence will be used.&nbsp; An occurrence includes a taxon, a date, and a  location.&nbsp; An occurrence can also include  ancillary data such as the person who identified the organism, </p>
<p>Examples:<br />
   - The x,y  coordinates of a Tamarix plant on December   1st, 1990<br />
   - Zebra  mussels were identified in Spain  on January 1st, 2000</p>
<p>Note: Occurrences could be organized either as locations for  a taxon or taxon at a location.&nbsp; Each has  advantages for certain types of data.&nbsp; As  long as the locations do not include polygonal data the form presented can be  used for either type of data as the IDs of the locations can be used to  reorganize the data back to taxon at a location.</p>
<h3>3.2 CheckList Record </h3>
<p>A checklist record, also referred to as a BioStatus  record, is the BioStatus of a taxon in a location without a specified date.</p>
<p> - Location<br />
   - BioStatus<br />
   - Citation  (optional but desired)<br />
   -  Ancillary:<br />
   -  Publication date<br />
   -  When I heard about it</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
   - BioStatus  of Tamarix in New Mexico,  citation<br />
   -  Invasiveness of Tamarix in New Mexico<br />
   - Tamarix  was published, in 1914, as being in New Mexico<br />
   - The  Tamarix entry in the 2006 invasive species list for Colorado</p>

<h2>4. Lists of data  types</h2>
<h3>4.1 Location List</h3>
<p>Set of locations (could be for a taxon, locations with  invasive species)<br />
   - Locations</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
   - A list of  the countries that a species occurs in</p>
<h3>4.2 Taxa List </h3>
<p>A list of taxa (typically at a location)<br />
   - Taxa</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
   - A list of  the non-native species in a particular country</p>
<h3>4.3 Check List</h3>
<p>A check list contains a check list records. </p>
<p>Examples:<br />
   - A list of  the BioStatus for all Asteracea for a particular country<br />
   - List of  invasive species in the United States<br />
   - Noxious  weeds in Colorado<br />
   -  Non-indigenous aquatic species in the US<br />
   - Invasive  animals in New Zealand<br />
   - List of  all invasive taxa anywhere</p>
<h3>4.4 Occurrence List</h3>
<p>Locations of a occupancies </p>
<p>Examples<br />
   - Locations  of Tamarix in New Mexico in 1990<br />
   </p>
