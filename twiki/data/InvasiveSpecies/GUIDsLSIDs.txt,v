---++ Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) and/or Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) for Invasive Species Information Sharing by the Global Invasive Species Information Network [[http://www.gisin.org][GISIN]]

__A discussion area for invasive alien species (IAS) information managers on how to deal with the need for GUIDs/LSIDs in order to share invasive species data among online databases with IAS information.__


---+++ Potential topics of discussion:

---+++++ GUID/LSID: how to ensure they are persistent?

---+++++ Who among IAS information managers is using GUID/LSID?

---+++++ Should there be a GISIN GUID/LSID service? If yes, who can/should host it?
   * Possible hosts:
      * [[http://www.gisin.org][GISIN domain server]]
      * GBIF
      * TDWG
      * [[http://www.nbii.gov][US National Biological Information Infrastructure]]

---+++++ Should there be a GISIN GUID/LSID master directory?

---+++++ Do any IAS information managers currently have a GUID/LSID information system in place?
   * [[http://www.discoverlife.org][Discover Life]]: see http://www.discoverlife.org/sc/ui/registry/
   * GBIF has one under development (?)
   * Others?
