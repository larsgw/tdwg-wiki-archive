FactSheetType has an element named !LocationSpecificIFacts (note 'I' before Facts) which probably should be LocationSpecificFacts. The supplied gif and existing TWiki commentary is for the latter although the schema itself has the former which therefore shows up in the gifs and the html representation. -- Main.BobMorris - 30 Dec 2005
