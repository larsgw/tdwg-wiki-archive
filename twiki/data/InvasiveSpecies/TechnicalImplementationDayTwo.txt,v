Structure issue


Taxon/Location

Location/Taxon

Location + Taxon + Relations


What to do with it?


Checklist Structure

Bob (BM): This is an XSLT issue.

Markus (MD): XSLT is fast


<taxon id='T1'>

	<location='L1'>	</location>

	<location='L2'>	</location>

</taxon>


<location='L1'>

	<taxon id='T1'>	</taxon>

	<taxon id='T2'>	</taxon>

</location>


	|| *Advantages* | *Drawbacks* |
|1. Taxon/Location|Natural choice, Human readable, Final choice by SD (after trials), Match facts sheet |Repetition|
|2. Location/Taxon	|Match checklist, Match source, XSLT==> Option 1	|Repetition, Location is harder to manage|
|3. Relational|Size, Match database structure, More flexibility|Manage keys, Require key generation (data is not normalized), More application tools, Difficult to process input|


*MB: Would Expertise fit as a top-level element?*

*BM: Likely to have keys/ID*


Hannu (HS): The data provider could map the data into the desired structure

What would be the impact on the checklist?


Shawn (SD): Keep it relational


Facts sheet = about 1 group of species + data from provider

this is weakly location-dependent

Facts sheet can vary a lot


HS: GBIF data repository tool can be used to process you spreadsheet data.

BM: Tools almost exist

DS: Not easy to normalize from actual data

Risk of duplication / Matching problems


BM: if we accept spreadsheet

- indentation

- multiple items in same cell (concatenated items)


MD: option 1 is more human-readable

(Wouter) WA: How do you extent the model if you should option 1?


SD: Define unique identifaction process

Location can be anything; difficult ==> Species (Option 1.)


BM/SD: Scientific name is not a good key ==> need better identification

HS: 10 more years for good naming system


HS: People will need to design a back-end database


BM: look at exercises ==> both Taxon (=1) &  Location (=3)

IAS experts work in a specific location


MD: Favours Option 2. 

_Taxon specific could be managed worldwide_


BM: Extensibility?

Problem if XML references IDREF


ODM: What will be do with the data?

SD/MD/HS/BM: portals can be built


WA: Problem using speadsheets / people mess it up

HS: Give users a tool to generate correct XML

BM: Excel file with comments & VBS = Solution

HS: Repository tool to validate input spreadsheets


---+++1. Strategy

MB: This is 100% technical

BM: Is there any restriction in the checklist?

MB: Use scientific name or common names + synonyms

BM: There is variation in the use of names

Best practices manuals


MD: ABCD is different: Higher taxon

MB: this is better.  Let's use ABCD Taxonomic type

Add synonyms to the schema


MB/BM: Biostatus could refer to the world

MD: Can we add DateOfLastObservation (for extinct species)?

MB: Please refer to ProjectOrCaseStudy


BM: We should not specialized any of the types.  Leave them optional


BM: biostatus & optional facts

but biostatus is part of facts. Not a good idea

MD: biostatus is generic?

BM: We need to rearrange facts/biostatus ==> HS: later


---+++Defer 1, 2 & 3

SD: Strategy is done

_HS: Need to look at use cases_

_BM: need scenarios (several hundreds)_


---+++DC/ABCD Extensions

BM: No more primary data

HS: Providers are keen to share primary data

SD/MD/HS: Some special data

HS: How do we support this additional unique information?

_MD: It could be recorded as a fact_

ABCD/EGS (Extended for GeoScientists)

_MD: Extension to a fact_


---+++Architecture

MD: List of supported operations (TAPIR):

- Get metadata about the host

- Capabilities (more technical description of information/functions available)

- Inventory operations (paging): list of distinct values / optional count/group by

- Search (paging):

- Get full / subset of schema

- (HS) Statistics: could be interesting

- Log request: proposal

- Ping

- Read/Only: only accept annotations


There is existing software

DIGIR does not support our schema


HS: "BioCase" protocol

MD: TAPIR is a messaging protocol


BM: Document data quality


SD: If I need to share a database

With DIGIR/BioCase/TAPIR (HS: about an hour setup time)

- Install PHP or other (ZOPE, Perl, XML, No ASP)

- Install DIGIR / provider software

- Define metadata for provider

- Map local DB (R/W) to DC schema (internal mapping)

- Register to GBIF UDDI (GISIN will be a new thematic network)

- GBIF requests a confirmation from the node manager before indexing


WA/MD: ODBC does not solve the differences in SQL syntax (ex. Group By problems)

BM: someone will implement it under SQL Server 


- ODBC to spreadsheet/Access option

- MD: Easy

- SD: Are you sure? What about MS-SQL, MS-Access?


ODM: Could we port TAPIR to SOAP

MD: requires work

MD: SOAP does not bring a significant advantage

HS/MD: TAPIR is another type of web service (HTTP GET)

 
SD: We could think about simple Get Request/Response exchanges

- Request information on a species

- Parameters: Species, Location, ...


---+++TAPIR vs SOAP

_BM: DIGIR/TAPIR is the recommended approach_

GBIF has addressed complex issues (caching/indexing) 

*BM: TAPIR should be the transport mechanism*

*Keep it open*

*Adapt to MS world/SOAP ==> more development required*


SD: Options to implement a data provider

MD: Different ways to harvest data to populate GBIF central cache

HS: ToR aim at an open architecture for GISIN

In practice.  Ex. Malika in Morocco.

Most developing countries will not implement a sophisticated data provider

_GISIN will be an heterogeneous network_

*There should be an easy implementation for each popular platform.*
