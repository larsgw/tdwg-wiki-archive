---+!! IASPS Schema (SVN v37) in HTML format

It is always better to use a Subversion (SVN) client and a good Schema viewing tool. For those who can conveniently do neither, here we link HTML made by XML Spy.  For maximum utility, these are made with inclusion of all the included schemas, but this is a nuisance because in most cases, e.g. ABCD, only a little of the included schema is used. One consequence is that it takes a long time to load the rresult, which has links to almost 1400 png files to represent the linked elements. Finally, note that as of SVN v37 (27 February 2007), the IASPS schema is heavily under reorganization. The SVN version refers to the SVN tree version at the time the HTML was made. Note that each file carries the highest tree version in which that file was modified, but the HTML integrates all the files and makes it hard to see this version number
