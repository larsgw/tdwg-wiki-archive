Although in Agadir we tried hard to avoid internal references (i.e. ID/IDREF or key/keyref), I now believe these may be unavoidable in some instances, including taxon names (because the same taxon may occur at several locations, and because there are representations of inter-taxon relations, such as hosts, bio-control, etc. that may be needed by several taxa or in several locations). We can almost certainly deal with comparison of several different instances of the same taxon used by using GUIDs. I think this will make the discussion come down to whether we choose the complexity of internal references or the size consequences of repeated taxa (or other resources, like images). Comments?
