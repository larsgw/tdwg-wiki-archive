---+++ Providing topics for elements not yet documented

As of 19 Nov 2005, the easiest thing to do for documenting schema elements not yet wikified is this:

	1. Edit IASPSSchemaAlphabetical to have the name of the new element. Be sure to use double brackets if it is not a TWiki.WikiWord. See EditingHintsForThisWiki. 
	1. After the edit,  IASPSSchemaAlphabetical should show the topic with a '?'. Click on that to open an edit session on the new topic. If you have a document already written, open it in another window and copy and paste the text into your edit session. Remember these points if preparing such a document:
		a. Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line
		a. To force it to be linked, you need double brackets around anything that is not a TWiki.WikiWord or is preceded by a '/'. See EditingHintsForThisWiki.
		a. Do *not* include the four lines of header text required in the old procedure. That functionality is now supplied by the Wiki itself.
		a. After saving the topic, visually check that terms for which you intend to have links, _including other element names not yet documented_ show up as links, even if only with '?' to show they have not yet been documented. The '?' will disappear as soon as the corresponding topic is created.
	1. Send Main.BobMorris the appropriate gif (s) named with the same name as the element you are documenting, together with the .gif extension.
I will be streamlining the gif procedure so that you can do it yourself.

---+++ To Do

Instead of having edit template put the common text on pages, adjust the master template so that it is part of the header. This will allow global changes to pages already existing, at the cost of having a template special to this web. -- Main.BobMorris - 19 Nov 2005

Provide links on every page to EditingHintsForThisWiki -- Main.BobMorris - 19 Nov 2005

Figure out how to keep images current as schema evolves -- Main.BobMorris - 19 Nov 2005

Figure out how to link CVS or !SubVersion to wiki and maintain the schema in one of those. -- Main.BobMorris - 19 Nov 2005
