---++Shared Accommodation

A good option for delegates to TDWG 2008 is to organize to share either a house or a unit with 1-5 others. This Wiki is to assist you in finding others who also want to share accommodation. The large majority of shared accommodation is in houses or units with 2 or more bedrooms, a kitchen and lounge. Accommodation options can be found at http://www.tdwg.org/conference2008/accommodation/.

The management of this Wiki is up to _you!_ We would suggest you add your name below. *PLEASE:* Once you have organized a share, take your name off the list!
