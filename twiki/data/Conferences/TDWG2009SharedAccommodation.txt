---++Shared Accommodation
This is a Wiki that delegates to TDWG 2009 in Montpellier can use if they wish to find someone to share accommodation with. Hotels in Montpellier will be relatively expensive to those not using Euros. One way of making accommodation 50% cheaper is to share it with someone else. Please feel free to add your name below with a few basic details, for example

Fred Bloggs (f.bloggs@fbloggs.edut.au) - looking for quiet, intelligent, tidy male to share room - November 9-13 inclusive 50-75Euros/night.
