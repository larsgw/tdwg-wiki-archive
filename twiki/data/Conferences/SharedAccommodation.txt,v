---++Shared Accommodation

A good option for delegates to TDWG 2008 is to organize to share either a house or a unit with 1-5 others. This Wiki is to assist you in finding others who also want to share accommodation. The large majority of shared accommodation is in houses or units with 2 or more bedrooms, a kitchen and lounge. Accommodation options can be found at http://www.tdwg.org/conference2008/accommodation/.

The management of this Wiki is up to _you!_ We would suggest you add your name below. *PLEASE:* Once you have organized a share, take your name off the list!

---+++Looking for someone to share
 
   * (An example) - Fred bloggs (f(dot)bloggs(at)gmail(dot)com) - anything with 2+ bedrooms!

---+++ Post-conference travel sharing

* *Beach exploration*  Is anyone interested in a few days of post-conference fun in the Perth area (Saturday to Monday or Tuesday)?  I'm looking for fellow ocean lovers to share the expenses and fun, including lazy types of beach enjoyment as well as high-energy activities like snorkeling and surfing.  Rottnest Island (rent cottage, bike, swim, snorkel and surf) is a possibility.  -- Main.ArlinStoltzfus (arlin [dot] stoltzfus [at] nist [dot] gov). @

   * As of a few hours ago there was a 2 bedroom townhome (Quay Gardens townhouse) available through Westerly Accomodations. It appears to be very close to the TDWG venue.  Contact through the [[http://www.fremantle.com/accom/westerley/index.html][Westerly webpage]]
