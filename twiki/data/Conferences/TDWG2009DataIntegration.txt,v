TDWG2009 is now on going and we are building a list of candidates for "Golden T-Shirts" on this page -> TDWG2009DataIntegrationNittyGritty

---++TDWG 2009 Theme 3: Data Integration
Theme Leader: Dr Roger Hyam (roger(at)hyam.net)



Integration means "make into a whole or make part of a whole". The purpose of the theme is to break down the silos of different data types that tend to occur in any domain and encourage the free flow of data thus enabling innovation in areas not yet envisaged. It would be counter productive to build yet another silo and label it "data integration".

The Data Integration theme will therefore be a cross cutting theme and should appear as a small part of every activity at the meeting.

---+++ How the theme will work

All presenters (both of talks and posters) will be approached and invited to label some element of their presentations (one slide or part of their poster) with the Data Integration logo. A handful of talks or workshops may be entirely dedicated to data integration.

Presenters will be encouraged to express how their work integrates with that of others. The specific questions they might address will be refined on this page but will include:

   * Who are the target audience for my work and what other data will they be using in their work?
   * How will people consume my data alongside other data?
   * How do I enable the consumption of data from more than one source?
   * What work is needed to enable people to use my data in combination with other data?
   * [Your question here...]

There will be a brief introduction to the theme on the first day and a summing up session on the last day. A single document (probably a wiki page) will prepared during the conference that will sum up what people are saying about data integration.

The theme could be thought of as a variant of the kids' game of "iSpy"  -- "iSpy Data Integration".

---+++ What is needed?
   * Your comments below
   * Volunteers to iSpy Data Integration during the conference.

---+++ Logos

These three logos are available to tag the parts of your talks that relate to the data integration theme. There are PDF vector versions of the logos available at the bottom of the page so you can create raster images at the sizes you need.
