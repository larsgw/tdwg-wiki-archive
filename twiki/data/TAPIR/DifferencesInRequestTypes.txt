---+++ Differences In Request Types

See also the ProtocolFeatures/RequestMethods for a discussion about extending the protocol for new request types.

---+++++ DiGIR
   * *metadata request* - returns metadata defined by the DiGIR protocol ([[http://digir.net/prot/current/metadataRequestExample.xml][sample request]], [[http://digir.net/prot/current/metadataResponseExample.xml][sample response]])
   * *search request* - returns records with a structure defined "on the fly" in a request ([[http://digir.net/prot/current/searchRequestExample.xml][sample request]], [[http://digir.net/prot/current/searchResponseExample.xml][sample response]])
   * *inventory request* - returns a list of distinct values (same as BioCASE scan request) ([[http://digir.net/prot/current/inventoryRequestExample.xml][sample request]], [[http://digir.net/prot/current/inventoryResponseExample.xml][sample response]])
   * *status request* - ? (not implemented)
Both search and inventory requests have a COUNT flag. When this flag is set to true the provider includes in the response the number of matched records (search) or distinct values (inventory) as a diagnostic element with the code MATCH_COUNT.


---+++++ BioCASE
   * *capabilities request* - returns list of data/federation schemas with the concepts mapped in the questioned datasource.
   * *search request* - returns records with a structure based on a federation schema chosen in the request. Any number of (federation/data) schemas can be supported. They just need to be configured/mapped by a provider first.
   * *scan request* - returns a list of distinct values (same as DiGIR inventory request)
