@---+++ Instructions for Software

The protocol might include a section holding optional instructions for processing software.

For example when trying to respond to a search request having a filter which specifies a concept a provider has not mapped. What is the wrapper software supposed to do? Abort the search with an error? Return an emtpy recordset? Ignore the unknown concept in the filter and set this COP to true?

It could be useful for a client to be able to specify such behavior in a request.
