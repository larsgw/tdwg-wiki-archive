Currently concepts can be referenced by filters as they are also considered a "simpleExpression" through substitutionGroup. To make it work for properties, it will be necessary to:

   * Remove the global element <concept> and the conceptType definition.
   * Make the global element <property> a substitutionGroup of simpleExpression, as it can be seen at ProposedChangesToOutputModelMapping.
   * unaryCOPType, binaryCOPType and multiCOPType will need to reference <property> instead of <concept>.

However, sometimes it could be interesting for clients to specify additional relationship conditions. One way to achieve this would be to define a new relationship element/type and a new class element/type (for classes participating in a relationship). The new relationship element would be a substitutionGroup of booleanOP so it could be used directly by filters, unaryLOPs and multiLOPs.

One condition would be that each class specified in a filter relationship would need to be: 

 1 present in the output model, or
 2. directly or indirectly related to a class that is present in the output model

Properties would also need to reference classes in the same conditions.

The new element definitions could be:

<verbatim>
<xsd:element name="classInRelationship" type="classInRelationshipType"/>

<xsd:complexType name="classInRelationshipType">
  <xsd:complexContent>
    <xsd:extension base="classType">
      <xsd:attribute name="role" type="xsd:String" use="required"/>
    </xsd:extension>
  </xsd:complexContent>
</xsd:complexType>

<xsd:element name="relationship" type="relationshipType" substitutionGroup="booleanOP"/>

<xsd:complexType name="relationshipType">
  <xsd:complexContent>
    <xsd:extension base="qualifiedConceptReferenceType">
       <xsd:sequence>
          <xsd:element ref="classInRelationship" minOccurs="1"/>
          <xsd:element ref="classInRelationship" minOccurs="1"/>
       </xsd:sequence>
    </xsd:extension>
  </xsd:complexContent>
</xsd:complexType>
</verbatim>

Note: Since supported booleanOperators are part of the capabilities response, a new element <relationship> would need to be included there (with <logical> and <comparative>).
