---+ Locked Tables

LockedTables are the list of tables associated to a RepNode, that are used (its compund primary keys) to loop over a SQL result set to create an xml representation of it. 

These LockedTables are essential for the PyWrapperAlgorithm to create a hierarchical xml document from a single SQL record set using primary keys of the joined table (aliases).
