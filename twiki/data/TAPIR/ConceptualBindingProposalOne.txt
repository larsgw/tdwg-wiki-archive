---+++++ Path based Conceptual Binding

To reference a concept it's necessary to:

 a. identify the ConceptualSchema it belongs to
      * --> schema namespace
   * identifiy the concept(element) within that schema
      * --> exact xpath to just 1 element

So a reference to any concept could look like this:

*<concept path="ns:/recordset/record/identification/fullname" ConceptualBindingProposalOne>*

or for attributes:

*<concept path="ns:/recordset/record/identification/@fullname" ConceptualBindingProposalOne>*

Where "ns" is a namespace prefix previously declared like: xmlns:ns="http://www.tdwg.org/someschema" 

Note: Another alternative for referencing schemas could be to use the xml ID & IDREF mechanism to refer via IDREF to a list of schema namespaces defined somewhere with their xml IDs.
