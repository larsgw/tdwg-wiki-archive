@---+ Search for a Partial Document

Subtpye of a SearchRequest. Search for a document in a well defined standard, the ConceptualSchema.
But do not return the complete document, but only a subset of it given by a list of requested concepts of that standard. The returned document still has to be a valid xml document for the requested ConceptualSchema, so it will likely include more data than only the concepts requested.
