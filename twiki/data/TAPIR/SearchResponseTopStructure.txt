---+ SearchResponseTopStructure

The top level structure for a search response.
It defines records and optionally includes associated metadata. When a metadata schema is defined by the provider, it cannot be removed from responses by a request. Records are grouped in a recordset according to the associated metadata, therefore the number of recordsets is the number of different metadata associated to the records being retrieved.
