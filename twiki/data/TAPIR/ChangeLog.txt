---+++ Changes during the documentation and implementation phase 2006
   * please see for ImplementationAndDocumentationChanges details
   * CapabilitiesReview accepted
   * Removed the* prefix from filter concepts in serialized filters, because a @ is used for aliased concepts or '::' for qualified ones. so we can detect concepts even without a* prefix. See GetInvokedOperations.
   * The delimiter for NS and ConceptId hash (#) is used in URLs as a fragment identifier and needs to be percentage escaped, so we suggest to use the double colon instead '::'.

---+++ early 2006
   * Created common base type for all operations to hold the following attributes that were previously part of the header in XML requests: envelope, xslt, and xslt-apply.

---+++ Changes during the 2005 Madrid meeting
   * Concept identifiers are not restricted anymore by the pattern _namespace_prefix:concept_id_ (when the namespace should have been defined as an attribute of some previous element). Now a concept identifier must be either fully qualified, or a ConceptAlias (defined according to a ConceptNameServer).
   * All operations can be invoked without using XML. See GetInvokedOperations
