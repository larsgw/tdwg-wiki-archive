In TAPIR, concepts are atomic and can be represented with fully qualified names.  A fully qualified concept name consists of a namespace URI followed by a pound sign, then a string identifying the concept.

When the concept referred to is defined in an XML schema, the concept identifying string is by convention, an XPath expression that will point to the element that represents the concept in a typical valid instance of the schema.

As an example, ABCD 1.2's SourceName concept is properly identified with the following fully qualified concept name:

http://www.tdwg.org/schema/abcd/1.20#/DataSets/DataSet/OriginalSource/SourceName

The first part identifies the namespace URI for ABCD 1.2 
The second part identifies that the SourceName concept can be found in most XML instances of ABCD 1.2 at the location FullyQualifiedConceptNameDataSets/DataSet/OriginalSource/SourceName

When the concept referred to is defined in an OWL ontology or RDF Schema, the concept identifier string is the name of the ontological class that represents the concept.

As an example, the DateLastModified concept in a hypothetical Darwin Core RDF schema could be identified with the following fully qualified concept name:

http://digir2.ecoforge.net/rdf-schema/darwin/2005/2.0#DateLastModified

It is always acceptable to refer to concepts within TAPIR using fully qualified concept names.  However, if a TAPIR implementation is aware of a ConceptNameServer, then one can use ConceptAlias instead of FullyQualifiedConceptName.
