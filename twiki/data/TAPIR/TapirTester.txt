TapirTester will then perform a series of tests to check if the provider is working correctly. Results are displayed in a list of "pass"/"fail" messages for each test case.

---++ Understanding the Output Messages

These are some of the possible errors/exceptions that can be found when testing a TAPIR service:

---+++++ PEAR error (16):Malformed response

This error usually means that there was a timeout triggered by the client (TapirTester). In this case, the service being tested is simply taking too long to respond to a specific request.
