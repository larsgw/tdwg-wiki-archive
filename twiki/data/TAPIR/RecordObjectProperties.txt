---+ RecordObjectProperties
A property of a RecordObject.

Properties are all elements immediately following the Record element of a RecordObject and are defined in other ConceptualSchemas. Properties can be complex and have a nested structure, but only the "root" elements within a Record element are considered being properties. This corresponds to classes having properties which themselves can be complex data types (being lists of other objects for example).
