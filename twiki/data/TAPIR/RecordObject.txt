---+ RecordObject
The protocol is record oriented in a way that it returns lists of something.
This something is called a record or RecordObject when we are talking about the structure of it.
The record element itself is defined by the protocol already (and mapped to a table when configuring a provider). All elements immediately following the Record element are defined in other schemas and are called RecordObjectProperties or short just properties. These properties can be complex and have a nested structure, but only the "root" elements within a Record element are considered being properties. This corresponds to classes having properties which themselves can be complex data types (being lists of other objects for example).
