DiGIRcase is somewhat problematic if someone asks "What does the 'case' stand for?" Since it had it origin as "Collection Access Service for Europe." That wouldn't be very global, or generic. 

"DiGIR" is a very good name for a protocol - it is succinct and memorable. It is also generic and non-partisan. However, it does already have a large following, so the combined protocol must be understood to be new and different if the DiGIR name is maintained.

"The GBIF protocol" doesn't suffer from these disadvantages, though it is more partisan and less generic than "DiGIR."

I think that both*GBIF protocol* and*TDWG protocol* are too general (as well as having the partisan aspect already mentioned).  My preference would be for*DiGIR 2* or*TAPIR* although it would be nice to reflect the contribution of BGBM/BioCASe somehow.  I just can't find a good name that does so.
