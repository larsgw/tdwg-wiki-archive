*Description:* The provider software is meant to connect a database with the help of the PyWrapper libraries and a configured ConceptualSchema to a BioCASE network.

The provider software is a collection of files to be installed on the provider's webserver. The core part of the provider software is the PyWrapper software. It is an XML/CGI database interface written in Python, which allows a standard access to a variety of database management systems and arbitrarily structured databases. This software therefore wraps the database into a standard XML format defined by the onceptualSchema.

The BioCASE ProviderSoftware currently consits of the following components:
   * a PyWrapper instance skeleton
   * a ConfigurationTool to assisst the configuring of any number of ConceptualSchemas to an arbitrary database
   * a LocalQueryTool to query the providers local BioCASE installation online
   * preconfigured ConceptualSchemas like ABCD, DarwinCore, the BioCASE metadata profile and more
   * a set of test pages to check the installation and the version of the important installed python libraries
