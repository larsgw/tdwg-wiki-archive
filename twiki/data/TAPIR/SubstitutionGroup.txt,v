@---+ Substitution Group

Substitutions groups require global elements to be used, as they are forced by schemas to be unique.
This way a unique identification of an element is guaranteed.

Unfortuantely this means that all elements refered to by substitution groups are required to be global. For complex hierarchical schemas this means they have to exist also as an flattened out version.

to be completed...
