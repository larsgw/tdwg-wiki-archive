---+ Custom Search Request

This is a "subtype" of a SearchRequest that allows to define a custom ResponseStructure for the response. It is equivalent to the existing DiGIR searches where you can specify a record structure to be returned.

For counting matches and returned records as well as the paging mechanism we need to give a RecordDefinition here, listing concepts from within our custom record structure. See RecordDefinition for more details.
