---+ Filter Encoding

For searches and inventories it is essential to specify a filter to select specific records. It is similar to the SQL WHERE clause and needs to do a ConceptualBinding to refer to a ConceptualSchema in a generic way.

The OpenGIS consortium has already created a similar filter schema for their protocols which might be reused here. It is available at http://www.opengis.org/docs/02-059.pdf from the OpenGIS site.

The simple reconcilitation of the existing protocols can be done as shown in the FilterOperators section.
