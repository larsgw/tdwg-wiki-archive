   * *ABCD* - Data standard for collection or observational data, see AccessToBiologicalCollectionData
   * *[[:ProtocolFeatures/AccessPoint:][AccessPoint]]* - UDDI term for a URL used to access a (web)service
   * *BusinessEntity* - UDDI term for an organisation hosting a (web)service
   * *ConceptualSchema* - A standard like ABCD or DarwinCore defining the data structure and concepts. It is referenced by the protocol for data exchange and query, but not for communication itself.
   * *ConceptualBinding*
   * *Datasource* - BioCASE term for a single wrapped database. Maps to an UDDI (web)service
   * *FederationSchema* - See ConceptualSchema above
   * *LockedTables* - a list of tables used to loop over a RepNode for a ResponseStructure
   * *NamesStandard* - Data standard under development dealing with biological names and taxa. see TaxonomicConceptTransferSchema
   * *NapierStandard* - see NamesStandard
   * *Provider* - BioCASE/DiGIR term for the organisation hosting a DiGIR/BioCASE service serving data. May consist of several resources accessible through a single access point (DiGIR) or seperate services with their own access point (BioCASE). See discussion about [[:ProtocolFeatures/AccessPoint:]["What is an access point"]] for more
   * *ProviderSoftware* - Software running on a providers webserver that includes a wrapper (see below) and some additional tools for configuration or a query portal.
   * *RepNode* - a repeatable node in a ConceptualSchema
   * *Resource* - DiGIR term for a single wrapped database sharing a single access point (URL) with other resources.
   * *SDD* - Standard for descriptive data, see StructureOfDescriptiveData 
   * *ServiceEntity* - UDDI term for a (web)service being provided. Binding templates define the Access Point to it.
   * *Wrapper* - Software allowing to access an arbitrary structure database in a standard way. In DiGIR/BioCASe this is the AccessPoint to a providers resource(s)
   * *XCQL* - XCQL is the CQL ('Common Query Language') expressed in an XML form. http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/cql/xcql.html
