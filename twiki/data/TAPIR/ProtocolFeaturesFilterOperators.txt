---+ Logical and Comparative Operators

Based on the DifferencesWithOperators of the CurrentProtocols a simplification and unification would consist of changes to the list of allowed operators as given below.

Additionally current binary logical operators (and,or) should be able to hold 2 or more operands, so that more complex filters with many LOPs do not need to be nested so much anymore.


*Logical Operators (LOPs)*
   * binaryLOP: and, or 
   * unaryLOP: not 
   * change maxOccurs of binaryLOPs to unbounded 

*Comparative Operators (COPs)*

   * unaryCOP: isNull
   * simpleCOP: equals, lessThan, lessThanOrEquals, greaterThan, greaterThanOrEquals, like 
   * multiCOP: in 

*Proposals for additional operators*
   * add SpatialOperators to work with geographic information.

---+++ Implication for DiGIR
   * add a new unary logical operator called "not"
   * add a new unary comparative operator called "isNull"
   * drop the operators "orNot", "andNot" and "notEquals"
   * change maxOccurs of LOPs to unbounded 

---+++ Implication for BioCASE
   * drop the COP "notEquals" 
   * drop the COP "isNotNull" 
   * change maxOccurs of LOPs to unbounded
