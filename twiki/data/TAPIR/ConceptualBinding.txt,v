@---+ Conceptual Binding

To define a filter and a ResponseStructure it is necessary to make references to concepts from a ConceptualSchema. In filters they are associated to a ComparativeOperator, and in a ResponseStructure they appear inside element or attribute definitions.

DifferencesInConceptualBinding shows how the protocols are currently dealing with this issue.

The new protocol already has these proposals:

In DiGIR this has been done using a SubstitutionGroup approach, while BioCASE uses an xpath-alike based approach. SubstitutionGroups cannot easily deal with hierarchically nested xml documents, so we follow the xpath based approach here.

---+++++ XPath based Conceptual Binding

To locate a concept it needs to:

 a. identify the ConceptualSchema that is being referred to
      * --> schema namespace
   * identifiy the concept(element) within that schema
      * --> exact xpath to just 1 element

So a reference to any concept could look like this:

*<concept schema="http://www.tdwg.org/someschema" concept="/recordset/record/identification/fullname" ConceptualBinding>*

or for attributes:

*<concept schema="http://www.tdwg.org/someschema" concept="/recordset/record/identification/@@fullname" ConceptualBinding>*


As a filter and especially a ResponseStructure definition might need a lot of concepts referenced, it might be useful to use a the xml ID & IDREF mechanism to refer via IDREF to a list of schema namespaces defined somewhere with their xml IDs.
