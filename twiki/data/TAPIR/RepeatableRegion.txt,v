@---+ Repeatable Region

A RepeatableRegion of a schema (defined by a CMF document or ResponseStructure definition) are all elements between 2 RepNodes (repeatable elements) including the top repNodes itself.

<verbatim>
A
  B*
    C*
      D
  E
</verbatim>
In this case B+E and C+D form repeatable regions. So if B is repeated, E needs also to be repeated.

See PyWrapperAlgorithm for details and examples
