*Description:* TapirLink is a generic TAPIR provider software based on the [[DigirProvider][PHP DiGIR provider]] (note: TapirLink is only compatible with TAPIR, not DiGIR). It uses the PHP ADOdb library to access different types of relational databases. A single instance of TapirLink can provide access to multiple TAPIR resources, each one with its own service address. TapirLink allows each resource to map one or more data abstraction layers. Search responses can be returned in many different formats, although only tabular (denormalized) data can be served.
