*Developers:* KevinRichards

*Availability/Location:* Available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tapirdotnet/

*SVN Location:* https://tapirdotnet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tapirdotnet 

*Language:* Microsoft .NET (C#)

*Description:* TapirDotNET is based on the TapirLink PHP TAPIR provider. It uses the OLEDB to access different types of relational databases.

A single instance of TapirDotNET can provide access to multiple TAPIR resources, each one with its own address.
TapirDotNET allows each resource to map one or more conceptual schemas following the DarwinCore pattern, but the idea is that it will only be able to serve instances of a single "class" or "entity". In other words, when mapping multiple conceptual schemas, each mapped concept will actually refer to an "attribute" or "property" of the same underlying class.

*Features:*

   * All TAPIR operations (metadata, capabilities, inventory, search and ping). 
   * KVP and XML request encodings.
   * Inventories on any mapped concepts.
   * Searches with any output models involving concepts from mapped  schemas.
   * Response structures with basicSchemaLanguage.
   * Log only requests.
   * Complete filter parsing. "Equals" and "like" can be case sensitive or not.
   * Control over maximum element repetitions and maximum element levels.
   * Multiple resources can be exposed from a single TapirDotNET instance.
   * Each resource can map one or more conceptual schemas based on the new DarwinCore pattern.
   * User-friendly web configuration interface including a UDDI registration form and the possibility to import DiGIR configuration.
   * A simple client (tapir_client.aspx) for testing.
   * OAI-PMH message handling.  After mapping the OAI-PMH structure to the data source, OAI-PMH requests can be handled and valid OAI-PMH responses are retuned from the provider.
