---+++ Road map: history and future plans

   * *April 2004:* Unification of [[DigirProtocol][DiGIR]] and [[BiocaseProtocol][BioCASe]] was considered a priority during the GBIF DADI sub-committee meeting in Oaxaca.

   * *June 2004:* GBIF commissioned a study that resulted in the [[http://www.cria.org.br/protocols/newprotocol.pdf][original integration proposal]].

   * *October 2004:* Original proposal was presented during the TDWG meeting in Christchurch.

   * *May 2005:* First reference implementation of a TAPIR data provider (PyWrapper).

   * *November 7th to 11th, 2005:* TAPIR meeting to review the protocol (new version of the XML Schema available).

   * *January, 2006:* New set of changes incorporated in the protocol schema to address a few open issues that were left after the meeting. First attempt of a protocol feature freeze. See: http://lists.tdwg.org/pipermail/tdwg-tapir_lists.tdwg.org/2005-December/000096.html

   * *April 2006:* First TDWG TAG meeting requested study about the viability of using ontologies in TAPIR.

   * *May, 2006:* TDWG contracted TAPIR documentation work, which will include a charter, a formal specification and a user guide.

   * *May, 2006:* TAPIR charter finished. See: http://www.tdwg.org/subgroups/tapir/charter/

   * *May, 2006:* Changes in TAPIR metadata response to make use of DublinCore, VCard and GeoRSS elements. See: http://lists.tdwg.org/pipermail/tdwg-tapir_lists.tdwg.org/2006-May/000208.html

   * *June, 2006:* IPGRI is now funding the PyWrapper update to support the latest version of the protocol.

   * *June/July, 2006:* Initial study about the possibility of making TAPIR compliant with ontologies and consequently improve output model mappings (See: SemanticMapping). The other possibility would be to drop dynamic output models (See: DroppingDynamicOutputModels). Although TDWG is already working on a general ontology, it will probably take some time until a stable and accepted ontology is defined. Decision was to postpone related changes in the protocol to a future version.

   * *July, 2006:* Adjustments made in the protocol during the PyWrapper update. See ImplementationAndDocumentationChanges.

   * *September, 2006:* PyWrapper adapted to the new version of TAPIR.

   * *September, 2006:* PyWrapper Config Tool adapted to TAPIR.

   * *October, 2006:* Formal specification finished. See: http://www.tdwg.org/dav/subgroups/tapir/1.0/docs/

   * *October, 2006:* Release of the first official version of the protocol (1.0). 

   * *October, 2006:* TAPIR approved as an official TDWG Task Group (as part of the TDWG Architecture Interest Group).

   * *January, 2007:* Minor changes suggested during the implementation of TapirLink (see: http://lists.tdwg.org/pipermail/tdwg-tapir/2007-January/000316.html).

   * *January, 2007:* Second TAPIR provider implementation available: TapirLink.

   * *February, 2007:* TAPIR developers workshop (see TapirWorkshop2007).

   * *April, 2007:* TAPIR Executive Summary finished.

   * *June, 2007:* TAPIR Network Builders' Guide finished.

   * *18th July, 2007:* First TAPIR service indexed by GBIF: Type collection of mollusca fossils from the Cenozoic of Java, Indonesia, and deposited in the Naturalis National Museum of Natural History, Netherlands (TAPIR service hosted by ETI BioInformatics).

   * *August, 2007:* Third TAPIR provider implementation available: TapirDotNET.

   * *September, 2007:* TAPIR promotional video available: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9404is3RJ8

   * *December, 2007:* TAPIR provider conformance tests available: TapirTester

   * *December, 2007:* First client library available: TapirChirp (PHP)

   * *July, 2008:* Online builders for output models and query templates: TapirBuilder

   * *December, 2008:* Second client library available: TapirJChirp (Java)

   * *5th February, 2009:* Specification submitted to the TDWG Standards Track.

   * *27th July, 2009:* All peer-reviews recommended acceptance.

   * *10th September, 2009:* Approved by the TDWG executive committee. Started the public review process.

   * *13th November, 2009:* TAPIR 1.0 approved as an official TDWG standard.
