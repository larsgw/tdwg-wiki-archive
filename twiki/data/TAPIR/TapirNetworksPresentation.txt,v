@Presentation giving life to this abstract:

-----
This session will discuss possible strategies about how to use TAPIR and will explain the different architecture components needed to build efficient networks. It will especially touch TAPIR models and their role in creating specialized networks on top of widely agreed conceptual schemas. An updated roadmap of implementations will be presented to better help people organize and target their projects.
-----

   * agree on concept list, add them to central CNS
   * create model(s) for to be used with mappings for those concepts
   * install services, configure them for the models
Optionally you can:
   * create templates to ease queries


Future ideas for networks:
   * Open Search A9 interface via templates?
   * specific RDF models, eg TCS RDF based on TCS schema concepts
   * OAI protocol interface
   * LSID resolution
