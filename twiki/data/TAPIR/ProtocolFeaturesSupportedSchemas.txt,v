@What kind of schemas and schema features are needed to be supported? 

List of things used in XML schemas, which might need to be supported:

- Hierarchical Documents?
  -> ABCD, SDD and the Names Standard need this.

- Cross-Referencing within Documents?
  -> SDD need this.

- Recursive Document Structures?
  -> SDD need this.
