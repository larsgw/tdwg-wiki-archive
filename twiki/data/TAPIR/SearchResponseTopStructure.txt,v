@---+ SearchResponseTopStructure

The top level structure for a search response.
It defines records and optionally includes associated metadata. When a metadata schema is defined by the provider, it cannot be removed from responses by a request. Records are grouped in a recordset according to the associated metadata, therefore the number of recordsets is the number of different metadata associated to the records being retrieved.

It defines records and always includes metadata which is defined by the provider himself and cannot be removed from the response by a request.
