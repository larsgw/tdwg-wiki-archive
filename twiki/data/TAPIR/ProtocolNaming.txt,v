@---+ Finding A New Name For The Unified Protocol

Current protocol name suggestions are:

   * *DiGIRcase*
   * *GBiF protocol*
   * *TDWG protocol*
   * *DiGIR 2*
   * *TAPIR* - TDWG Access Protocol for Information Retrieval
   * *XDiDAPro* - XML based Distributed Data Access Protocol
   * *YAP!* - Yet Another Object Access Protocol
   * *CORP* - Complex Object Retrieval Protocol

Feel free to comment or add more

*comments:*

DiGIRcase is somewhat problematic if someone asks "What does the 'case' stand for?" Since it had it origin as "Collection Access Service for Europe." That wouldn't be very global, or generic. 

"DiGIR" is a very good name for a protocol - it is succinct and memorable. It is also generic and non-partisan. However, it does already have a large following, so the combined protocol must be understood to be new and different if the DiGIR name is maintained.

"The GBIF protocol" doesn't suffer from these disadvantages, though it is more partisan and less generic than "DiGIR."

I think that both*GBIF protocol* and*TDWG protocol* are too general (as well as having the partisan aspect already mentioned).  My preference would be for*DiGIR 2* or*TAPIR* although it would be nice to reflect the contribution of BGBM/BioCASe somehow.  I just can't find a good name that does so.

I think that both*GBIF protocol* and*TDWG protocol* are too general (as well as having the partisan aspect already mentioned).  I do not like*TIRP* or*DIRP* because they both sound a little silly.  My preference would be for*DiGIR 2* or*TAPIR* although it would be nice to reflect the contribution of BGBM/BioCASe somehow.  I just can't find a good name that does so.
