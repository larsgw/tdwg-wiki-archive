@---+ Methods Supported by the Protocol

Currently the following request methods are identified to be useful for the new protocol.
They are mainly based on the DifferencesInRequestTypes of the CurrentProtocols.
Are they sufficient or do we need more convenient methods for specific problems?


---+++++ Major Request Types

   * ProtocolFeaturesRequestMethodsPingRequest: Check if a provider or resource is online.
   * ProtocolFeaturesRequestMethodsCapabilitiesRequest: Ask the provider for his "know concepts". That is metadata about the concepts that are mapped and are existing in his database.
   * ProtocolFeaturesRequestMethodsMetadataRequest: Request a providers metadata only.
   * ProtocolFeaturesRequestMethodsSearchRequest: Search a datasource to receive structured data.
   * ProtocolFeaturesRequestMethodsInventoryRequest: Ask for a list of distinct terms within 1 concept. A scan request in BioCASE terminology.
   * ProtocolFeaturesRequestMethodsCountRequest: Request the record number of a scan or a search. Is this a request on its own?

---+++++ Potential New Request Types

   * a method for replication or complete data dumping?

   * a method for write access to databases for feedbacks and annotations? What kind of requests do we need for this?Updates, Inserts, Deletes?
