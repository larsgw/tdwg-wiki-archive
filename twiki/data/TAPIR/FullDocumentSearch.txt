---+ Search for a Full Document

This SearchRequest subtype will always return the most complete document possible with all data available for a requested ConceptualSchema. It is comparable with an SQL SELECT* statement.

The only parameter needed for this request is an identifier to the ConceptualSchema for which we use its namespace.
