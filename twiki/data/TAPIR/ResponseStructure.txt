---+ Response Structure

The response structure is the "format" the data is returned in.

To define a ResponseStructure one needs to define a set of valid xml instance documents. For this several languages exist with DTDs and XML schema s being the most used and known.

There are 2 reasons for creating yet another simple language to define an xml instance document "space".
   * it is desirable to have the definition as xml. Xml schemas match this criteria.
   * we need to be able to attach to every potential valid xpath within the space of all instance documents additional information. This is needed to map the concept an element of the custom ResponseStructure to a concept defined in a ConceptualSchema.

---+++++ Proposed Response Structure Definition
   * CustomSearchProposalTwo defines the response structure with the help of XML schema.
   * CustomSearchProposalOne defines a simple response structure using a custom language following the xml schema language as far as possible. 

For both proposals we proposed to use the xpath based ConceptualBinding.
