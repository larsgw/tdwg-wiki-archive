---+ Repeatable Node

A RepeatableElement, also called RepNode, is any xml element in a ConceptualSchema that could occur more than 1 time - thus maxOccur of the element in the schema definition is > 1 or "unbounded".

Each RepNode has a list of tables associated to it, that are used (its compund primary keys) to loop over a SQL result set to create an xml representation of it. Those tables are called LockedTables.
