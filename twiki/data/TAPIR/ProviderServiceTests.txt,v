See TapirTester for the first conformance test service available for TAPIR providers.

---------------------

Tests for provider services should assure the correctness of two things:

A) The installation is working
  *

B) The service software is behaving according to the TAPIR specifications
   * Validate all request types against the schema
   * For all request types check
      * supply requests in XML and KVP encoding
      * turn envelope on/off for all (only search should work)
   * SEARCH ONLY
      * If error occurs in search, envelope should not be turned on automatically
      * If count is requested, envelope is turned on
      * test omit-ns@
