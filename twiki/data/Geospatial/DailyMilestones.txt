      * Install an set up a copy of openModeller services on the server - Tim & Renato
      * Name Search Services ready - Bart & Pete
      * Ocurrence services - Dave
      * Scripts to process occurrences - Javi
  
   * Achieved:
      * Install mapserver and register environmental layers as WCS resources - Tim & Aimee
         * mapserver and WCS resources working
         * also library to pull WCS data and save on the filesystem
      * Install an set up a copy of openModeller services on the server - Tim & Renato
         * working
      * Name Search Services ready - Bart & Pete
         * service  finished but needs testing 
         * html front end working
      * Occurrence services - Dave
         * gets GBIF occurrence data
         * gets WFS occurrence data
      * Scripts to process occurrences - Javi

   * Coconuts Required to Achieve Goals: 10

---++ Tuesday April 3
   * Planned
      * implement WCS data pull - Aimee
         * save to /opt/data/envdata, register in catalog - Aimee
         * register /tmp/omcache - Tim
      * implement PHP to interact with OM service - Tim
      * Name Search, Flex front end - Pete
         * output in UTF8
      * Web interface - stub all operations in front page (index)
      * implement connection with Data Processing Service (DPS) - Dave & Javi
         * interface allows load WFS capabilities doc
         * prototype must go through and look for available feature types, check that GML application schema is understandable
      * Make sure 2 parameters are sent for WFS or WCS - base service url and feature type or coverage
      * Create final document structure


   * Achieved:
      * implement WCS data pull
      * MapService creation on the OM server.
      * getAlgorithms, getLayers... almost all done from the Omservice side
      * NameSearch now worksw fine and provide accepted name.
      * HTML interface has fastly improved
      * connection with DPS is working and implemented in Flex.
      * cheks for avaialble featureTypes in a WFS service
      * Passsing parameters between different screens and the final picture is a lit of confussing
      * The document report has not been started...
   * Cost - 5 coconuts
---++ Wednesday April 4
   * Planned
      * Create WCS layer metadata retrieval service - Javier
      * Upload WCS layer to OM server and return OM getLayers compliant ID - Aimee (server side), Tim (php service)
      * Get occurrences from WFS Uri - Dave
      * Run model - a wrapper for createModel, projectModel and getMapAsWcs - Aimee & Tim
      * Complete UI integration PHP (Pete & Bart) - Flex (Javier)
      * Implement OGC result browser (openLayers?) - Dave

   * Achieved:
      * Get occurrences from WFS Uri - Dave
      * Create WCS layer metadata retrieval service - Javier
      * Upload WCS layer to OM server and return OM getLayers compliant ID - Python part done, PHP still half.
      * Run model half implemented
      * OpenLayers installed and preconfigured

---++ Thursday April 5
   * Planned
      * Make the RunModel work with interfaces - Tim, Javi & Pete

      * Prepare a little bit a demonstration of use - All
   * Achieved
      * Run model seems to work but not much tested
      * the openLayers interface is up and running with some performance issues using MapServer
      * TAPIR integrated in the HTML frontend
      * Demonstrated at CRIA with success :)

---++ Pending issues after the workshop
   * Backend
      * Make the python scripts work with PHP to be able to use WCS resources with openModeller
      * Test the performance of MapServer together with OpenLayers as this looks like it is a problem
      * Implement Catalogue of Life Web services in addition to SPICE

   * HTML frontend
      * Display the model result at the end of the experiment
      * Use of external WCS services for modeling
      * Add CoL web service interface

   * Flex frontend
      * Be able to display occurrences in Yahoo Maps
      * Overlay in Yahoo Maps WMS and WFS of model results
