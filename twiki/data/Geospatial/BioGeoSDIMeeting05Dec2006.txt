---++ Agenda

   1 Congrats everybody for the accepted proposal!
   1 Lees comments about the proposal
   1 Where and when is the meeting finally going to happen?
   1 Should we have other possible attendees
   1 Deviations from the proposal?
   1 Pre Workshop Preparation
   1 Move to new mailing list
   1 Areas where additional funding may be needed




---++ Congratulations

Mutual thanks and back patting were exchanged for the successful application for TIP funding for a pilot implementation of an interoperability demonstrator.

---++ Notes on feedback from Lee Belbin

   * There is a possibility of applying for further funding to support our proposal if needed, but we should identify any such need as soon as possible
   * We should carry out this project with the idea of presenting our work to the OGC (OGC-TDWG)
   * We should keep in mind TAG / LSID best practices
   * Two other projects that relate to the SubStandards proposal got rejected (Spatial Data Library and High Performance openModeller). There was some discussion about the possibility of pursuing these goals independently of TIP funding (at a slower pace though). 

---++ When and where is the meeting going to happen?

   * A mid march meeting at CRIA, Campinas, Brazil does not work so well for CRIA
   * Javier noted that the OGC meeting is April 19th so ideally the workshop should be held before then - but that it is not critical

Preferred dates:

   * Tim - April
   * Aimee - April
   * Pete - April
   * Dave V - after March 10
   * Javier - March or first week of April
   * Dave N - Early April
   * Renato - Early April
   * Patricia - not present at the meeting (sorry was at another meeting, begin April is fine for us)

The first week of April was finally proposed subject to final aproval from Vanderlei (director of CRIA)

---++ Additions to the attendee list

Pros and cons of additional attendees were discussed. However the lack of space at CRIA and a desire to keep things really simple was expressed. It was resolved to leave extending the attendees list for now - keeping the possibility open for additional invitees if we identify obvious areas where we are missing expertise.

---++ Deviations from the proposal?

Possible deviations were discussed but at present we do not envisage any deviations.

---++ Preparation for workshop

Some discussion took place regarding preparations for the workshop. The following items were highlighted:

   * We need to thoroughly flesh out the simple use case scenario
   * We should create some screen mockups of the desired user interfaces
   * We should identify exactly which standard services and protocols are to be used and where attention will be needed regarding 'glue' code between protocols
   * We should identify specific roles for workshop attendees
   * It was briefly discussed to use python as the main programming language for our prototype development


---++ Move to new mailing list

It was agreed to move to the new TDWG mailing list

---++ Possible areas where additional funding may be needed
   * Possibly a subgroup meeting to coordinate deployment of openModeller clusters
   * Possibility of getting funding to work on SDL for a week before the workshop
