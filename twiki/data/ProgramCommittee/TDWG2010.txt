---+++Suggestions & Commentary
---++++From Donald Hobern 
(As Chairman, we have considerable inclination to accept these unless we feel that they are not appropriate.)

   * TDWG standards and support for citizen science and observational data - the BioBlitz would be a way to focus the problems and possibilities
   * BHL and digital literature - improving the tools and integration

---++++Elizabeth Arnaud
   * Any agrobiodiversity at TDWG2010? Can nominate a contact if TDWG wishes
   * Gail Kampmeier thinks that it would be great to follow up last year's start with the involvement of agrobiodiversity (both genebanks and agricultural research data).  The US Dept. of Agriculture would be a natural fit with this.  Would be willing to brainstorm.  
   * GBIF is interested in leading a session on the NORDGEN/Bioversity project aimed at applying the IPT to EU genebanks in support of the agrobiodiversity Portal. This is the first project showing how we could apply the GBIF tools/infrastructure and extensions for a thematic community. (contacts: Samy Gaiji, Dag Endresen, Elizabeth Arnaud)

---++++ More ideas for sessions at TDWG2010 ...
   *  Biodiversity Informatics Standard APIs: programming libraries and services for routine works
   *  OGC - and domain relevant biogeographical aspects
   *  Wild ideas - I liked these sessions in Perth & Montpellier, but would suggest doing them on the first day to spur thinking throughout the conference instead of on the last day.
   *  "Plumbing"- Hardware & Infrastructure to support biodiversity datasets
   *  How do we use GUIDs? - There has been a vivid discussion over the last years about the choice  of technology for implementing GUIDs for our community, which is still not concluded. A related and even more important issue has received relatively little attention: How does Biodiversity Informatics make use of GUIDs? For example: What defines the identity of a taxon (or a name, a reference, a language, a region, a specimen, a sequence, etc.)? Or in other words: Which operations on a taxon object change it in a way that it has to be considered a new taxon so that a new GUID has to be assigned. These considerations are highly important for the interoperability of our networks but have never been seriously tackled. The session would consist of presentations of projects/initiatives that have implemented or intend to implement GUIDs and explain their individual strategy. This could be followed by broader discussion about the development of a common TDWG strategy.
   * Data Quality Measures: This session would be about software tools and workflows for improving data quality in biodiversity databases and networks.
   * Progress on taxonomic standards (GNA, PESI, etc.)
   * Additional info on other BioBlitz organised for the 2010 year of Biodiversity : The Open Air Laboratories (OPAL, see also http://www.opalexplorenature.org/ ) partly based at the NHM London, are so kind to share their BioBlitz experiences.
   * Management of open-source software development projects - particularly collaborative development, replication of mirror databases, etc.
   * The evolution of the GBIF portal (to cover vocabularies in use, names, registry, web services, etc. (contact: Tim Robertson, GBIF).
   * The DwC archive for checklists; could show checklist bank, also; session could cover all DwC extensions (contact: David Remsen, GBIF).
   * An infrastructure for development, maintenance, governance of vocabularies/ontologies (contact: Bob Morris, or Éamonn Ó Tuama, GBIF).
   * A "hands-on" workshop" based on the GBIF "beginner's guide" to persistent identifiers which should be published around this time (contact: Éamonn Ó Tuama, GBIF or Kevin Richards, Landcare Research, New Zealand).
   * The GBIF Registry and data hosting infrastructure (contact: Vishwas Chavan, GBIF).
   * Data citation mechanisms (contact: Vishwas Chavan, GBIF).
   * The MRTG schema and its relation to the virtual herbarium (contact: Vishwas Chavan, GBIF).
   * GBIF and the Map of Life - could be part of a broader geospatial services session (contact: Tim Robertson, GBIF).
   * Cloud computing and the availability of GBIF data for scientifiic analysis (contact: Samy Gaiji, Tim Robertson, GBIF).
