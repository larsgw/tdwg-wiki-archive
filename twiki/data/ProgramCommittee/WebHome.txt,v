---++TDWG 2009 
This is a workspace for the TDWG 2009 Programme Committee

   * Annie Simpson (asimpson@@usgs.gov)
   * Patricia Mergen (patricia.mergen@@africamuseum.be)
   * Joel Sachs (jsachs@@csee.umbc.edu)
   * Elizabeth Arnaud (e.arnaud@@cgiar.org)?
   * Adrian Rissone (A.Rissone@@nhm.ac.uk)

---++Starting Point
This is a copy of the part of Donald's email post to members and friends that relates to the TDWG 2009 programme. This committee should, as far as possible, seek to follow the wishes of the TDWG Chair (as endorsed by the TDWG Executive Committee).

"In recent years TDWG conferences have moved away from their earlier format, with significant emphasis on working group meetings, to become more of a reporting conference on the activities of TDWG-related projects.  This has had some benefits, but has also in some ways weakened the organisation by reducing our focus on the core activity of developing and promoting standards.  The vitality of our working groups in large measure depends on the conference providing a focus for their activity.
 
For this reason, TDWG 2009 will be structured differently.  Monday and Friday of the conference have been reserved for plenary sessions, but for the rest of the conference we plan to run three parallel (and, I hope, intersecting) streams of activities.  One of these will be on the use of biodiversity informatics to support agriculture and crop diversity.  Another stream will be for TDWG to initiate activity in response to the roadmap developed at e-Biosphere 2009.  The third stream is still be be selected.  Each stream will include a range of activities (e.g. symposia, seminars, task group sessions, hackathons) planned to address key issues and to result in real deliverables to progress biodiversity informatics in the area.
 
We are establishing a Program Committee to plan the conference in detail and will keep you informed of progress."

---++Things To Do (please add/delete/modify)
   1. Clarify the three themes (eBiosphere outcomes, agricultural biodiversity informatics, ??). Suggestions from TDWG 2008 and subsequent emails to me are listed in the TDWG 2009 Ideas document below. Eamonn and Patricia were supporting the idea of biodiversity informatics in developing countries. Donald more recently feels that it would be good to try and weave in the issues raised by Annie (Lee: hence on the Programme Committee) of how TDWG addresses problems of new 'application groups' such as Invasive Species (see http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/InvasiveSpecies/GisinRequirements).
   1. Identify the three 'Theme Leaders'. They will have autonomy to develop their programme and interact with each other and this committee to ensure effective coordination.
   1. Identify the titles and Sessions Chairs for each of the eight 1/4 day sessions on Monday November 9th and Friday November 13th.
   1. Determine if and how poster and computer demonstrations will be run and identify Editors for OJS for the abstracts.
   1. Contact group Conveners encouraging a) inputs to Theme Leaders, b) Session Chairs and c) Any requirements for group meetings. Aspects of this are somewhat of a catch-22 in that Conveners may request a session as in (2) above.
