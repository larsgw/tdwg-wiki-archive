---++ Why


---++ Basic Principles
   * The TDWG ontology is only concerned with shared data. It is a model of the semantics that are actually needed to communicate. This does not mean that TDWG as an organisation is only interested in shared data but it is the purpose of *this* ontology. [Observation: Anecdotely it appears that ontologies must have a purpose or they will be useless].
   * The management technique should differentiate between speculative/research based concepts and those that are actually used so that users can make judgements about their value.
   * The management technique should, where possible, be by an explicity set of rules rather than judgement calls - although these can't be elliminate entirely.
   * There will be an ontology editor/administrator who runs the system.
   * All items (classes or properties etc) within the ontology will have an adoption level.

---++ Ontology Adoption Levels
   1. Experimental - Not visible to people outside the task group who are working on it.
   2. Shared - Visible to other task groups who work on ontologies but not to the 'general public' by default. To become shared the task group must show The Editor a working example of data being served and consumed e.g. an LSID provider which returns data using the construct. This is a purely technical test so the editor can just decide with only minimal consultation. It prevents task groups swamping other groups with loads of new concepts that they can't demonstrate use of. Shared concepts can be deleted without warning.
   3. Suggested - Visible to the public and suggested for other groups to adopt. To reach this stage real data has to be served and consumed across the network on the basis of this concept. The decision to move to suggested may need to be OK'd by the TAG or Executive.  Suggested concepts are never deleted they merely become deprecated.
   4. Recommended - Real data is being served and consumed on the basis of the concept by people other than those who created it. This is equivalent to a real rock solid standard. The decision to move to recommended must be OK'd by the TAG or Executive and is not likely to be reached by a suggested concept for several years. Recommended concepts are never deleted they merely become deprecated.
   5. Deprecated -  Formerly shared or recommended. May be in use. Not recommended or suggested for future adoption. Will be maintained indefinitely for historical reasons.
