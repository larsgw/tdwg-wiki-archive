The stated strategy of the Technical Architecture Group is to "Produce a yearly review and forecast of technical issues within TDWG prior to the annual meeting - The Roadmap." This Roadmap document therefore provides the most up to date summary of the TDWG standards architecture.

The current Roadmap is being developed on the RoadMap2007 wiki page. 

The precursor of the Roadmap was the report from the first meeting of the TAG held in 2006. You can read this report and comment on it on the TagMeeting1Report page.

The 2006 road map document was presented at St Louis. You can read the a road map document [[%ATTACHURL%/roadmap_04.doc][here]].

---++ Discussion 

Please discuss the road map on [[http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-tag_lists.tdwg.org][TAG Mailing list]] or add feedback to the associated wiki page.

---+++ Editorial Note
I (Main.RogerHyam) have just radically overhauled this page as of verions 8. The old version is available by clicking on the history at the bottom of the page. If you feel there was something that was on the old page that should remain here please cut and paste it from the old version. Thanks.
