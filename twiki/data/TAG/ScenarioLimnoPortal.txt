---++ Summary
A *fantasy* project that collates the data from ScenarioLimnoGene and ScenarioDesmidSurveyNet into a human readable front end and aggregated data portal.

---++ High Level Goals
A need has been recognised for a portal for those working in Limnological research. This will take data from the ScenarioLimnoGene, ScenarioDesmidSurveyNet and present it alongside related data gathered from the sources listed by the GBIF data portal and news feeds from researchers blogs.

The portal can not know how to present all the data it is likely to come across but will have to rely on the standards architecture to give some indication of human readable labels (possibly in multiple languages) to generate page layouts dynamically.

---++ Actors
   * Portal developers. 
   * TDWG collaborative infrastructure
   * GBIF data portal

---++ Flow of Events
   * Portal developers consult TDWG collaborative infrastructure and design portal engine to consume and present data in standards that conform to the TDWG standards architecture.
   * Portal developers build portal.
   * Portal discovers data from data sources registered with GBIF data portal and presents it.
