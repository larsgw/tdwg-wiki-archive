-> debate over what a publisher is. Realise that we have reached 'difficult bit' so back off.

Initial debate over Actors and Use Cases was productive in that we realised that it was futile and we needed to talk in more general terms (lower level?)

-> So it is difficult to nail down these roles/actors
-> So we should abandon it...

---++ Primary Use Cases (these are lower level than we started with)
   1 What we are primarily interested in is sharing!
   1 Network must be able to exchange identifiable objects.
   1 Objects may related via their identifiers.
   1 Objects may be related via their composition.
   1 Search
   1 Query
   1 Resolution

Are we interested in sharing data that is not part of an identifiable object?

Yes: For querying. Results of a query (SQL for example) are not identifiable objects.

----++ System Model

   * There is a clear line between classes and instances ( vocabulary and data) but this line will be in different places depending on the application. Some people may consider taxon concepts as classes or descriptive terms etc...

   * We can talk about data and we can talk about vocabularies and we are referring to different sides of this line without specifying where the line is.

   * There are certain things for which LSIDs are not appropriate. It would be legal to use them for RDF resource identifiers for controlled vocabularies and XML Schema locations BUT we would have to extend existing software libraries to do this which is not desirable.

   * We recommend that LSIDs are not used for controlled vocabularies.








   * LSIDs should be limited to URI not IRIs at the moment.




Querying is a distinct use case that may or may not be supported by a 'node'.




What is an object?
