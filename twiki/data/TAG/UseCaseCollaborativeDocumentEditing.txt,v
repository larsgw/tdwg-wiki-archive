Several scientist agree to jopin their respective expertise and collaborate on generating an identification key, taxonomic monograph, ecological fact collections (including knowledge on invading species).

They would like to use a program that allows them to
   * analyse the data they are creating to find gaps or errors and increase the consistency
   * use the data in a digital format, including search methods
   * keep track of individual contributions to simplify clarification of disagreement
   * document contributions to make IPR contributions transparent
   * publish the document and make it searchable by indexing services such as GBIF

Essential conditions for the use case is that individual scientist start and manage a focussed project for which a focussed result 
is desired ("document"), similar to a publication in print. The software facilitating this may either be a central web-editing application that enables users to manage their projects, or distributed applications that use actual document-files being sent around by socially well accepted mechanisms like email.
