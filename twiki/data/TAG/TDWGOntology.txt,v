See TDWGOntologyTerminology for the language to used in describing the ontology.

See TDWGOntologyConstructs for a discussion on what modelling constructs should be used in the ontology.

The version of the ontology on this page will be frozen for testing purposes until the end of August 2006, with the exception of adding textual definitions to those classes in which they are currently missing.

---+The Current Ontology
The current draft of the [[http://tdwg.napier.ac.uk/ontology/ ontology]] in OWL as presented at TDWG 2006.

The previous version with related discussion links can be found at: http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TAG/TDWGOntology?rev=24

---+Base Ontology

The BaseOntology contains the highest level classes and attributes within the TDWGOntology such as BaseThing.

---+Core Ontology

The CoreOntology comprises classes mostly representing terms in common usage such as CorePerson, from which biodiversity specific classes forming much of the TDWG community temrinology is defined.

---+Biodiversity Informatics Core Ontology

The BdiCoreOntology comprises classes mainly derived from 4 of the existing TDWG XML schemas. The subgroups involved in the inital version of the core ontology are ABCD, Darwin Core, SDD and TCS. These schemas have been analysed to attempt to determine the high level concepts that should act as a core for a larger TDWG ontology to be developed by the whole community.


This page is primarily aimed at facilitating discussion and development of the core ontology by members of the subgroups represented in the TAG group. It is anticipated that the core will 'grow' to include concepts necessary to fully express the existing schemas as well as those schemas currently under development.
It rapidly becomes clear that an ontology needs to be managed and the creation of the seed ontology is the ideal place to develop and establish the management structure, see TDWGOntologyGovernance for details.

TDWGOntologySizeOfProblem is a page to discuss how big the problem of creating a core ontology is by looking at the usage of the current schemas.

---+Biodiversity Informatics Core Ontology (BdiCoreOntology)

The BdiCoreOntology contains biology specific extensions to classes contained within the CoreOntology.

---+++Discussion

Main.MarkusDoering - 24 May 2006: Since specimens and taxon observations share most of their properties (gatheredIn, hasMedia, identification) I suggest to derive CoreSpecimen from something like a CoreTaxonOccurence. This is what ABCD and DwC consider a unit or record.

----

Main.GregorHagedorn - 28 Apr 2006: I propose to change CoreGeographicRegion to CoreGeographicArea (see comments on CoreGeographicRegion), CoreIdentification to CoreTaxonIdentification (you can also identify persons) and add a CoreGeolocalisation for the analogue identification of the place where a collection event occured. 

----

Main.DonaldHobern - 19 Apr 2006 - I'm not fully sure about the characteristics of the ontology we wish to create.  For clarification, do we expect all core classes to be "first-level" or do we expect to make use of an inheritance tree?  For example, should we have a core class which represents a "taxon occurrence" and have both CoreSpecimen and CoreObservation extend it?
a42 29
Main.GregorHagedorn - 28 Apr 2006: I would welcome having such inheritance in the core classes. Requiring core class to be all directly inherited from the base class seems to me to be artificial.

----

Main.GregorHagedorn - 28 Apr 2006: I believe we need to have a short descriptive paragraph for each core class what the intended scope/coverage is. For example, CoreObservation may be a taxon observation, a measurement of air temperature, or a measurement on a taxon. Are all these intended, or just part? Or if we introduce a CoreTaxonOccurrence type that clarifies what kind of observation, does this include just one taxon plus time and place? In pathology the relevant occurrence data of a disease involves two organisms (host, pathogen), a geographic location and a time. Similar occurrence data exist for pollinators, etc. Without some specification I would not know whether we consider organism interactions a separate core class or not. - Gregor

----

-- Main.HerbertSchentz - 11 May 2006: It is quite natural that a lot of core concepts will also cover other domains like air measurement, soil monitoring and so on. I propose that we don't explecitely exclude these overlappings. Those can be the connection points to other domain ontologies, if we once try to integrate them.

---- 

-- Main.RogerHyam - 27 Apr 2006) have changed the above paragraphs to talk in terms of a 'Seed' ontology rather than a 'Core' ontology as I believe the purpose of the exercise is to create a seed from which the larger ontology will grow. This will become clear if you read the TDWGOntologyGovernance. People I spoke to don't seem to mind this change so I have gone aheard and made it. I have also added the notion of a base ontology as discussed at TAG-1 to contain the super class TDWGThing and any meta classes etc. Delete this message later!

Main.GregorHagedorn - 28 Apr 2006: Any better name than TDWGThing? Thing seems to cover only physical objects (perhaps including persons), not concepts like taxon names or descriptive terms. Also I believe it should not contain TDWG, maybe the organisation will ultimately change its name to something better...

Please see also the old UBIF discussions UBIF.ObjectOntology

----

-- Main.DaveVieglais - 25 May 2006: 

   $ BaseSpaceInTime:  Implies that space and time are not separable, which does not seem correct.  A location can exist without time, and it is easy to imagine situations where location is not important for an event (e.g. when something is identified).  Why is space and time bundled together in this class?

   $ BaseThing: Why is there a title slot?  Does everything require a title, or does this state simply that everything can have a title?

The BaseOntology will be contain the highest level classes and attributes within the TDWGOntology such as TDWGThing and a meta class.

Main.GregorHagedorn - 28 Apr 2006: Any better name than TDWGThing? Thing seems to cover only physical objects (perhaps including persons), not concepts like taxon names or descriptive terms. Also I believe it should not contain TDWG, maybe the organisation will ultimately change its name to something better.

This page is primarily aimed at facilitating discussion and development of the seed ontology by members of the subgroups represetned in the TAG group. The subgroups involved in the inital version of the seed ontology are ABCD, Darwin Core, SDD and TCS. These schemas will be analysed to attempt to determine the high level concepts that should act as a seed for a larger TDWG ontology to be developed by the whole community.

It rapidly becomes clear that an ontology needs to be managed and the creation of the seed ontology is the ideal place to develop and establish the management structure see TDWGOntologyGovernance for details.

-- Main.DonaldHobern - 19 Apr 2006 - I'm not fully sure about the characteristics of the ontology we wish to create.  For clarification, do we expect all core classes to be "first-level" or do we expect to make use of an inheritance tree?  For example, should we have a core class which represents a "taxon occurrence" and have both CoreSpecimen and CoreObservation extend it?

-- And what kind of occurrence? In pathology the relevant occurrence data of a disease involves two organisms (host, pathogen), a geographic location and a time. Similar occurrence data exist for pollinators, etc. - Gregor

The core ontology is being developed from the knowledge gathered during the processes of defining 4 of the existing TDWG XML schemas. It is anticipated that the core will be extended to include concepts necessary for schemas currently under development. This page is primarily aimed at facilitating discussion and development of the core ontology by members of the subgroups represetned in the TAG group. The subgroups involved in the inital version of the core ontology are ABCD, Darwin Core, SDD and TCS. These schemas will be analysed to attempt to determine the high level concepts that should exist in the core ontology. From these concepts domain specific concepts will be extended from the core concepts with properties suitable for supporting implementations.
