%ICON{"warning"}% This vocabulary has been superseded by the TaxonOccurrenceLsidVoc. Read more about it on the TaxonOccurrenceLsidVoc page.

This is a summary of the LSID Vocabulary for Specimen. Read LsidVocs  information  on LSID Vocabularies in general.

See OccurrenceRecordLsidVoc for a diagram illustrating the relationships between an occurrence and a Specimen. The Avowed schemas and CNS files for OccurrenceRecord and Specimen are very similar because they embed one another.

   * Locality 
I believe that it is an error to include the geographic-object attributes (coordinates, etc.) as part of the specimen. Many other objects need them as well, especially taxon observations. -- Gregor Hagedorn, 2007-05-03

I don't follow Gregor's objection.  OccurrenceRecordLsidVoc indeed has such attributes. But there seem to be two issues: (a).  OccurrenceRecordLsidVoc supports both geocoded and named locality, but SpecimenLsidVoc seems to support only the former and (b)even if this is an oversight, there is a data integrity issue if an OccurrenceRecord and its voucher specimen have different localities. One possible solution is to have a voucher class (generalizing both specimens and e-vouchers) and put the location only on vouchers. This would probably give rise to a need to have a sort of empty voucher that contains little but locality and something representing the source of the voucher (collecter, photographer, publication, ...)
