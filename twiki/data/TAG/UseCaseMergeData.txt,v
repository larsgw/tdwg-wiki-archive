It must be possible to collect data from multiple data sources and combine it in some meaningful way.

Steve Perry gave a good example:-

Portions of the TCS data model describe specimens, publications, and 
other things that are not names or concepts.  In a perfect world, TCS 
would not define it's own data model for specimens but would instead use 
an existing model designed by the curators of collections (perhaps with 
Darwin Core as a starting point).  The same is true for publications.  
Instances of TCS should then use GUIDs to point to instances of Specimen 
and Publication. 

Now, imagine a hypothetical system that provides for visualization of 
TCS, a Taxon Concept Browser that allows researchers to search for and 
view TCS instances in order to select a set of concepts to use in their 
own work.  At some point, this system will have to have an in-memory 
graph of data objects of different types including TCS, Specimen, and 
Publication.  This graph could be constructed in a variety of ways, but 
the most likely method will start by parsing a TCS document that 
contains several taxon concept instances.  Each instance will be 
examined for references to other objects named by LSID.  Each of these 
LSIDs will be resolved (with care so as to not create cycles), resulting 
in a chunk of serialized data which will be turned into an in-memory 
instance and inserted into the graph.  This is at heart the merge case I 
was talking about above.

---++ Subcases
There are three subcase of the merge data case:

   1. Merge data about the same kinds of object from different data sources but in exactly the same format e.g. specimen data in the same version of the sames schema.
   1. Merge data about the same kinds of object from different data sources but in different formats e.g. specimen data but in different versions of the same schema (ABCD & ABCD2) or different schemas completely (ABCD, ABCD2 & DiGIR).
   1. Merge data about different kinds of objects from different data sources. e.g. TaxonConcept data with literature data, specimen data and descriptive data.
