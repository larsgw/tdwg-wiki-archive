---+ How to Contribute
You are welcome to [[TWiki.TWikiRegistration][register]] and contribute to our discussions and documents. If you do register please create a page for yourself that describes who you are and your interests in TDWG standards. 

---++ Narrative Not Discussion
This wiki should read like a completed document not like a discussion. Please don't add comments like "I don't think this is correct..." or "In my opinion..". If a certain point is debatable then a list of pros and cons should be stated as objectively as possible. Just edit the page to show both sets of opinions clearly stated. Discussions should occur on the mailing list and the results posted here. Please do sign your work using the signature that is supplied at the bottom of the edit box.

---++ The <nop>ToDo Page
If there is something that you think should be dealt with but you don't have the time/inclination/skill to do it yourself then please add it to the ToDo Page.

If you are looking for a way to contribute then you could pick something off the ToDo page. Don't forget to take it off the ToDo page when you have finished it.

---++ <nop>FixMe Convention.
If you contribute to a topic or are reading a topic and you feel that something is wrong or incomplete then please label it like this (FixMe: a comment). All pages containing the FixMe TWiki.WikiWord (but not this one) will be listed on the FixMe page and so can be tracked and fixed. Do not over use FixMe. Try to leave things in as complete a form as possible.

If you are looking for something to contribute you could start by visiting the FixMe page and picking something off the list.
