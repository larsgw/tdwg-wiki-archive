Javier says:

In the real world there will be lot of times where we will need to create XML schemas from these TAG classes and the TDWG subgroups classes. The best example, as pointed out by Flip in a previous message, is that we will need to implement our models in GML. Why? Because all OGC standards are based on it so if we want to play with them we will have to use their rules.
I think he also pointed out about a document to do GML app schemas from UML models with automatic derivation. There is also an article from IBM about modeling  XML using UML (http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-wxxm23/).
In this article is discussed the need to do automatic derivation to keep synchronize the modeling task with the programming task. 

I think this is importance so maybe it is worth to include it as a kind of requirement. But again, depending on how far TAG wants to go this might be more a discussion for the different TDWG subgroups.
