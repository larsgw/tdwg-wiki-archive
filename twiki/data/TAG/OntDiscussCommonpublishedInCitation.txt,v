The definition of the attribute:

"A link to a citation object that expands on the publishedIn property."

needs some revision.

1. I cannot find the "publishedIn" property referred to here. "publishedIn" is also similarly mentioned many times in http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonName, but the property is not present there either. I am not sure whether I failed to find the source for "publishedIn" (please help to find it) or whether it had been renamed.


2. I am not sure about the usage. I believe in the use case of data integration, we need a distinction between a source of information, and references/citations made within that source. Example: "Distribution Germany, England, France (Ref. 1, 4, 88, 37, 5)" Here the information cites references, but none of the references is in itself the source of the information, which has already been aggregated by the next higher aggregator. - Can we disambiguate between these?

   1. The publishedIn property is here: http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/Common#publishedIn 
   1. The reason for the existence of these properties it to disambiguate from the Dublin Core 'source' property. At least in the case of TaxonNames one might want to say the source (the place where it was found by this person)  is a publication or web page etc but that it was publishedIn another location. The meaning shades in other types of object. TaxonOccurrence, imperfect as it is, has a derivedFrom (http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonOccurrence#derivedFrom) to differentiate a derivation chain from the source where it was found and the publishedIn where the actual description occurs.
