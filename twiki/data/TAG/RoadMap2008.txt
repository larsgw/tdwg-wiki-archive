The stated strategy of the Technical Architecture Group is to:

 _"Produce a yearly review and forecast of technical issues within TDWG prior to the annual meeting - The Roadmap."_

This page was  used to develop the 2008 Roadmap document. This work is now complete. If you need to see how it progressed you can look at the change history for this page.

The finished document is now available as a PDF file: [[%ATTACHURL%/TDWG_TAG_Roadmap_2008.pdf][TDWG_TAG_Roadmap_2008.pdf]]

Roadmaps were also produced for 
[[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/pub/TAG/ArchitectureOverview/roadmap_04.doc][2006]] and
[[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/pub/TAG/RoadMap2007/TAG_Roadmap_2007_final.pdf][2007]].
