Many areas in biodiversity research show huge gaps in the availability of up-to-date taxonomic revisions and identification tools. One reason for this is that the current workflow is highly inefficient. To revise a taxonomic group, where perhaps only 5% of information truly needs revision, requires spending almost the original time to also enter and correct data for the other 95%.

Revisions occur in a frequency between perhaps 10 and 100 years. An archival format that captures the essences of the previous digital taxonomic revision (online-monograph) and allows subsequent revisions to built on the work of predecessors, coupled with a license making this legally possible is highly desirable.
