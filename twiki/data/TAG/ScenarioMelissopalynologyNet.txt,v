---++ Summary

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissopalynology][Melissopalynology]] is the study of the occurrence of pollen grains within honey from honey bees. In this *fantasy* project 10 labs are building a distributed system for analysing the origins of honey, detecting adulteration and using bees as parataxonomists. Can honeys from areas that are not well known taxonomicaly shed light on the flora of the region? Can habitat loss be detected from the changing content of honey?

---+++ High Level Goals
The labs wish to develop a data exchange standard for honey samples. This standard will include elements such as:
   * Geographic data about the location of hives and flights of bees.
   * Provenance data about how the honey has been processed.
   * Taxonomic data concerning taxa and pollen grains (extended to include generic taxa for those grains that can't be identified to specific monophyletic groups).
   * Taxon occurrence data concerning the vegetation around hives.
   * Flowering time data.
The labs wish to publish their data to a wide audience including the food processing industry.

---+++ Actors
   * People: The Melissopalynology Net developers. Food industry quality assurance personnel. Taxonomic researchers.
   * Systems: Data indexers such as GBIF data portal and food industry portals. TDWG collaborative infrastructure.

---+++ Flow of Events
   1. Developers visit TDWG collaborative infrastructure and pick the exchange standards that support their goals.
   1. Developers develop an exchange standard that includes established TDWG standards and elements unique to their domain.
   1. Developers submit their services to GBIF data portal and food industry portals.
   1. Workers in the food industry can discover and explore data relating to the provenance of honey in terms of biodiversity without their systems having _a priori_ knowledge of the project. At the simplest level they can browse from food ingredient back to geographic origin to taxon and associated species pages.
   1. Workers in plant conservation can discover new occurrence records based on data gathered by bees.
