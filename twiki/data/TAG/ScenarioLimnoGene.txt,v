---++ Summary

Limno Gene is a *fictional* project that connects 15 labs world wide who are working on gene expression within the bodies of fresh water. They have developed a technique for examining anonymous expression of genes within planktonic and benthic species. They need to exchange data between the labs and would like others to make use of the parts of it they may find useful.

---+++ High Level Goals
The network will need to integrate data from the following domains:
   * Data on gene expression produced by the new techniques (this is bespoke and new to science).
   * Gene relationships [[http://www.geneontology.org/][Gene Ontology]] project.
   * Taxonomic data about the organisms occuring within bodies for fresh water ( possibly TCS or other existing format).
   * Taxon occurrence data.
   * Limnological data about water quality (pH, temperature etc)
   * Geographic data about location of sampling points (including depth).
Memembers of the network will both produce and consume all data types apart from the first.

---+++ Actors
   * People: Limno Gene developers, TDWG TAG group.
   * Data Sources: GBIF data portal or other integrator; TDWG collaboration infrastructure.

---+++ Flow of Events
   1. Limno Gene developers visit TDWG collaboration infrastructure website and reach an understanding of available exchange standards.
   1. Limno Gene developers realize that the current exchange standards cover most but not all of items they would like to exchange.
   1. Limno Gene developers implement an exchange standard that includes elements from existing TDWG standards and from the [[http://www.geneontology.org/][Gene Ontology]] project.
   1. Limno Gene developers register their services with the GBIF data portal and other data integrators.
