The stated strategy of the Technical Architecture Group is to "Produce a yearly review and forecast of technical issues within TDWG prior to the annual meeting - The Roadmap." This Roadmap document therefore provides the most up to date summary of the TDWG standards architecture.

The current Roadmap is being developed on the RoadMap2007 wiki page. 

The precursor of the Roadmap was the report from the first meeting of the TAG held in 2006. You can read this report and comment on it on the TagMeeting1Report page.

The 2006 road map document was presented at St Louis. You can read the a road map document [[%ATTACHURL%/roadmap_04.doc][here]].

---++ Discussion 

Please discuss the road map on [[http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-tag_lists.tdwg.org][TAG Mailing list]] or add feedback to the associated wiki page.

---+++ Editorial Note
I (Main.RogerHyam) have just radically overhauled this page as of verions 8. The old version is available by clicking on the history at the bottom of the page. If you feel there was something that was on the old page that should remain here please cut and paste it from the old version. Thanks.

There are two documents that summarize current thinking regarding the TDWG technical architecture:
   * The first is the report of the TAG-1 meeting. You can read this report and comment on it on the TagMeeting1Report page.
   * The second is the road map document - for which we currently request feedback. You can read the a road map document [[%ATTACHURL%/roadmap_04.doc][here]].

This is a one page summary of the proposed architecture. It is a dynamic page and will change as new opinions are added. It is deliberately terse and links to (or will link to) pages which give fuller explanations and justifications.

---++ A TDWG Ontology.
d11 1
a11 1
Currently TDWG has 3 XML schemas passed as standards plus other exchange standards that may be come TDWG standards or which TDWG standards may want to interact with. These include: ABCD & ABCD2, TCS, DarwinCore & variations on, SDD, HISPID4 & earlier versions, NatureServe, EML, NBN exchange format.
d13 1
a13 1
There are other exchange standards outside of biodiversity informatics that TDWG standards should be integrating with so as to foster interoperability in the future. These include: DublinCore, vCard, Open Biomedical Ontologies, Others...

If an architecture is to provide some over view of the data formats then it must, at a minimum, state how the terms used within the existing standards are related. Some attempts to map between standards have been made but any extension of this would lead to a incredibly complex network of relationships. Each new schema would have to be compared to all the others. Chaining of concept relationships would lead to a confused and messy ontology for example  A = B and B = C and C = D etc till we reach the point where E bears little relationship to A but could is logically identical.

*The only way to provide an overview is therefore to build an ontology that terms in the current and proposed standards are mapped to.*
a18 1
The nature of the ontology, how it is built and maintained, will need to be clarified but there does not currently appear to be an alternative.

---++ Role of transfer formats.

Once a ontology is in place then the existing transfer format can be viewed as serialisation of data whose semantics are captured in both the structure of the document and in the TDWG ontology.

The development work in Tapir has been working towards this. Using the transfer formats as 'conceptual schemas' and allowing the client to define different response structures that may bear little relationship to the structure of the original standard. DiGIR has permitted simple custom response formats since the beginning.

The need to capture ALL the semantics in the _structure_ of future transfer formats may come into question. It may be possible to serialize data as a series of assertions in RDF (this does not imply searching based on RDF or mapping all data into triples - see below).

---++ Serving Data
Serving data typically means a query-response model. There is the possibility of a push model but that won't be discussed here. For the sake of clarity the following definitions will be used:

   1. *Resolving.* This means to convert a pointer into a data object. Examples would be to resolve an LSID and get back either data or metadata or resolve a url and get back a web page in html.
   2. *Searching.* This means to select a set of objects (or their proxies) on the basis of the values of their properties. The objects are  predefined (implicitly part of the call) and we are simply looking for them. An example would be finding pages on Google.
   3. *Querying.* This means to ask a question of a data source that returns objects that are defined as part of the call. An example would be an SQL query where the response object (tuples) are defined in the query.

Using only 'resolving' it would be possible for an agent to crawl around and data harvest (i.e. a web crawler). Using resolving and searching would make the crawler more efficient at gathering data for specific tasks. Querying allows arbitrary data retrieval.

At a single data source resolving should be easy to implement technically, searching slightly harder and querying 'non-trivial'.

Resolving is 'easy' to do in a distributed environment (e.g. just use DNS like LSID) and searching is harder but can be federated (many examples including Rod's work) or cached (GBIF, Google). Distributed querying is 'non-trivial' in the extreme though some GRID guys will probably solve it for us in the future.

After the GUID-1 meeting in February 2006 it is assumed (for the time being) that the GUID technology of choice for serving data in the biodiversity informatics community will be LSID. This doesn't mean that LSID will be the only GUID technology encountered. The publishing and library communities will continue to use DOI and Handle technologies and so client softwared needs to be able to deal with these technologies.

-- Main.RogerHyam - Apr 2006

I cannot find the place where GUID-issues are discussed, so I place my contribution here: UsePURLsAsGUIDs and WhyWeShouldNotUseLSIDs.

-- Main.GregorHagedorn - 28 Apr 2006

The appropriate place to discuss GUID specific issues is on the [[http://wiki.gbif.org/guidwiki/wikka.php][TDWG GUID Wiki]].
