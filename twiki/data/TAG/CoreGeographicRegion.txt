I assume this intends to cover geographic areas (= named area defined, like nat. park, watershed, city, province, country), but not necessarily anonymous point locations. To me GeographicRegion seems to imply a higher geographic level (only province and above) - but I am not a native speaker. Geolocation may be similarly not ideal, misleading to point location. I propose CoreGeographicArea as a more appropriate term. -- Gregor Hagedorn

Do we need a separate object "point location"? These are not necessarily named.
