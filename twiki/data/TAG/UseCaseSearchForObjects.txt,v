It must be possible to retrieve a set of objects on the basis of their properties.

*Searching* This means to select a set of objects (or their proxies) on the basis of the values of their properties. The objects are  predefined (implicitly part of the call) and we are simply looking for them. An example would be finding pages on Google.
