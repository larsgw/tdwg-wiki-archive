---++ Hypothesis

[[http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/][W3C Semantic Web Activity]] appears to provide all the tools required to build a rich data exchange system. Why don't we just use them? 

Background: [[http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Offices/Presentations/SW_QA/#(14) ][Semantic Web Q&A]] |

---++ Pro: Data handshaking becomes simple
It is easy to combine data from different vocabularies on the fly. Can integrate with other efforts.
Don't have to keep coming up with new schema.

---++ Pro: Management of versions becomes less problematic

---++ Pro: Many available tools

---++ Pro: Many other people doing it so have expertise to call on

---++ Pro: Many other people doing it so can integrate with their data

---++ Con: Not as good for validation as XML Schema

---++ Con: Have to have a central ontology that all agree on.

---++ Con: RDF is not GML
This is an interesting point of view on it - http://www.mapbureau.com/gml/
