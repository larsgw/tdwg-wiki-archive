---++Discussion

I agree with the class definition except for the note "in relation to a CoreTaxonConcept". I believe in biological data we have (at least) three kind of identification events:
   * Identification of an individual object as a class member
   * Identification of an individual object as a named individual (in common life usually persons, but in biology often highly relevant for ecological/behavioral studies like survival, mating. In some experiments these identifications are trivial because individuals are uniquely tagged (rfid, visual numeric code), in other experiments the use of natural individualistic characteristics like fur pattern makes identifications similarly potentially doubtful as the more common individual-to-class identification.
   * Identification of the locality at which an event, e.g. a collection or observation of an organism took place. The original data may be expressed in a way that enables an interpreter to interpret or infer further locality data, e.g. in which grid- or coordinate position according to current systems the event took place. Thus, geolocality identifications may be repeated and require data who did the "identification".

I therefore propose subclasses (or perhaps to skip this generalized class CoreIdentificationEvent) for TaxonIdentificationEvent, NamedIndividualIdentificationEvent, GeolocalisationEvent.
