Below is a screenshot of the entire class hierarchy of the UBIF and SDD schemata. The colored part is what we consider the [[TDWGOntology]]-equivalent part in UBIF and SDD. 

Note that we would believe in deriving or compositing specimen from taxon occurrence, which probably should derive from !AbstractEvent, and include multiple !TaxonIdentification and Geolocalisations. The UBIF dataset has some placeholders for this, but this is clearly the task of other groups. For SDD a very simple Specimen based on human-readable string suffices. However, we did have to include some structure inside !TaxonName to be able to express our data.

For the w3c-schema please see [[http://wiki.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/SDD/DiscussionFor1dot1beta10]] which also has an attached copy of the beta version.

We very much welcome any comments, criticism and insight, just mail me or use the SDD wiki.
