This page describes the terminology used in describing the ontology. It is important that we use the same words with the same meaning. *Note that we are defining words for our use not for general use.* Although our usage should not conflict with others we only need to take our domain (the TDWG ontology) into account in the definitions.

   * %RED%Concept%ENDCOLOR% - This is confusing and should be avoided although it is used in BioCASE and TAPIR mappings.
   * %GREEN%Class%ENDCOLOR% - A template for the definition of a collection of objects. (rdfs:Class)
   * %GREEN%Property%ENDCOLOR% - An attribute of a class or quality typically associated with a class. (RDFS may have the domain of a class).
   * %GREEN%Object%ENDCOLOR% - An instance of a class.
   * %BROWN%Instance%ENDCOLOR% - Synonymous with Object.
   * %GREEN%Relationship%ENDCOLOR% - A state of connectedness between two Objects (RDFS a property with a domain of one class and a range of another).
