The Exchange Network is a secure Internet- and standards-based approach for exchanging environmental data and improving environmental decisions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, State environmental departments, and U.S. tribes and territories are partnering to build the Exchange Network to increase access to environmental data and make the exchange of data more efficient.
