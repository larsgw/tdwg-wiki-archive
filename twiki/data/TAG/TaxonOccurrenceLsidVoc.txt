This is a summary of the LSID Vocabulary for TaxonOccurrence. Read LsidVocs  information  on LSID Vocabularies in general.

The motivation for this vocabulary is to represent DarwinCore type data in a simple way. A more refined vocabulary for occurrence data in general may be developed in the future under the auspices of [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/osr/][Observation and Specimen Records]] interest group.

---++ Further Information

Note that this vocabulary replaces the suggested OccurrenceRecordLsidVoc and SpecimenLsidVoc and effectively merges all the fields from both vocabularies.

There are several reasons for this:
   1 There was debate about the placement of the 'identifiedTo' property. It was proposed in the OccurrenceRecordLsidVoc that only occurrences were identified and that Specimens were simply vouchers for occurrences. This was not accepted. It is too much of a leap to make for people  working in collections.
   1 Mapping of DarwinCore records between the two objects was very difficult because the basisOfRecord property in DarwinCore is largely uncontrolled. If we can't map existing data we can't use the new vocabulary.
   1 On examination it was not necessary to rename any of the properties when the two classes were combined. This indicates it is not necessary to have them in separate namespaces.
   1 The resulting structure is simpler and can be used almost entirely flat apart from for the identifiedTo property. The general principle that simpler is better should be applied.
