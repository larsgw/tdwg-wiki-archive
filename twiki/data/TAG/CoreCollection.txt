---++Discussion

1. Collection seems to be more general than specimen collection. We definitely have media object collections, (and also, non-specimen-related data collections). Dublin Core uses collection in a more general sense as well. A decision whether to specify this to !SpecimenCollection or to subclass it is necessary here.

2. Current property ownedBy range = CoreInstitution is too restrictive, a specimen collection may be owned by other agent types (especially persons) as well.
