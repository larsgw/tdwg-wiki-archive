---+ <nop>%TOPIC%

This is a summary of the LSID Vocabulary for <nop>TaxonConcepts. Read LsidVocs  information  on LSID Vocabularies in general.

Note that there are two views onto the vocabulary from the point of view of XML Schema. TAPIRLink (and DiGIR providers) require flat schemas and no TAPIR wrapper will support recursive structures in XML Schema so it is difficult to express taxonomic hierarchies and horizontal Taxon-Taxon relationships such as heterotypic synonymy. The answer is to model two endpoints in such protocols. One endpoint to retrieve individual TaxonConcepts and one to retrieve TaxonConcept Relationships. The Relationship objects can contain either embedded TaxonConcepts or just links to the actual concepts. A client can navigate and reconstruct a graph of concepts by querying for Relationships. Two calls (one to get all the parent relationships and one to get all the child Relationships) should retrieve an entire taxonomic tree from any datasource. (Two calls are required because datasources are not guaranteed to map inverse relationships - some may do child only or parent only).

   * *Description:* 
   * *Comment:*  This is not a full rendering of TaxonConcept as
         presented in the Taxon Concept Schema 1.0. Not all the possible concept-concept relationships
         have been modelled just the basic set theory and  taxonomic hierarchy relationships. RelationshipAssertions
         have not been included. These omissions will be addressed in collaboration with the first
         data provider/consumer pairs who need to make use them.
