This page is to discuss the current ontologies, how they are used and how they are currently related. It also touches on how they may be represented in a central ontology so that they might be synonymised to shared concepts.

---++ DarwinCore
At first it appears small but when the different flavours are taken into account the number of properties seems quite high. See TDWGOntologySizeOfProblemDarwinCore

A possible approach is to have a main DarwinCoreRecord class that contains most of the properties and a few subclasses to capture the extensions. It may be worth having a cascade of several subclasses.

---++ ABCD

ABCD appears big at first. There are over 900 mapping-concepts and 800 more in the EFG extension. But a look at actual usage suggests that effort could initially be focussed on a subset - see TDWGOntologySizeOfProblemABCD - There are around 109 'most popular' concepts that could be focused on.

An analysis of existing classes in global schema types and elements of ABCD can be found here: TDWGOntologyABCDAnalysis

If we wanted to represent ABCD in the ontology then perhaps an ABCDUnit, ABCDGathering class...?

Mapping to DarwinCore has already been looked at see [[here][http://www.bgbm.org/tdwg/CODATA/Schema/Mappings/DwC2.0.htm]]

---++ BDI.SDD_

A diagram of the class hierarchy defined in the UBIF and BDI.SDD_ xml schemata can be seen here: [[UBIFandSDDClasses1dot1]]

See the [[BDI.SDD_][BDI.SDD_ wiki]]
