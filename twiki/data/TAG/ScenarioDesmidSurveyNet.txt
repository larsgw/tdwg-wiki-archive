---++ Summary
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmid][Desmids]] are algae of fresh water (mainly). Five labs are cooperating in this *fantasy* project to create a network to pool results of standardised surveys of standing water. 

---++ High Level Goals
Data exchanged needs to contain a combination of data from existing and emergent TDWG standards:
   * Geographic data on location of sample sites.
   * Details of sampling techniques used.
   * Taxonomic information on organisms sampled.
   * Ontological data linking different sampling procedures so that cross survey results can be pooled.
   * Limnological data concerning water quality.

---+++ Actors
   * People: The DesmidSurveyNet developers. Taxonomic researchers.
   * Systems: Data indexers such as GBIF data portal. TDWG collaborative infrastructure.

---+++ Flow of Events
   1. Developers visit TDWG collaborative infrastructure and pick the exchange standards that support their goals.
   1. Developers develop an exchange standard that includes established TDWG standards and elements unique to their domain.
   1. Developers submit their services to GBIF data portal and other portals.
   1. Workers in conservation and water quality studies can discover new occurrence records based on data gathered for survey purposes..
