The first TAG meeting took place at the [[http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/][eScience Institute]] 11-13 April 2006 and was kindly hosted by Jessie Kennedy under the [[http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/themes/theme_02/index.htm][Exploiting Diverse Sources of Scientific Data]] theme.

A final report has been prepared for the meeting and can be dowloaded and commented on: TagMeeting1Report

---++ Motivation

The [[http://wiki.gbif.org/guidwiki/wikka.php?wakka=GUID1Workshop][GUID-1]] meeting on 1-3 February 2006 at [[http://www.nescent.org/main/][NESCent]] was the first of two meetings held as part of the [[http://wiki.gbif.org/guidwiki/wikka.php?wakka=HomePage][TDWG/GBIF GUID project]]. 

The [[http://wiki.gbif.org/guidwiki/wikka.php?wakka=GUID1Report][outcome]] of this meeting was to propose the use of Life Science Identifiers ([[http://lsid.sourceforge.net/][LSID]]) as the preferred GUID technology within the Biodiversity Community. This has major implications for developing a TDWG 'common architecture' for its standards. Many of the objects found in the domain will soon be tagged with globally unique IDs. There are immediate plans to tag specimens, TaxonNames and TaxonConcepts and it is proposed to tag literature records, images and other objects.

LSIDs are resolvable identifiers and the LSID specification recommends the use of RDF to encode metadata. This suggests an architecture consisting of a number of discrete objects encoded in RDF and linked by LSIDs.

There is funding available for a small team to meet and discuss the implications of this decision and make recommendations for how to proceed.

---++ Attendees

A call was made through TDWG mailing lists for participants. Attendees of this first meeting represent the main technologies in use in the TDWG community. The intension is to produce a consensus view of the current technical situation, challenges and opportunities that can be presented to wider community as a coherent vision. The meeting is being kept small to maintain focus. The list of attendees is given below and is now closed. If you would like issues raised at the meeting please bring them up on the TAG mailing list or approach one of these attendees and ask them to represent your views.

---++ Agenda
A detailed Agenda for the meeting is being prepared on another wikipage: TagMeeting1Agenda

---++ Outputs
The meeting will produce a written report that will be presented to the TDWG Executive Committee and then circulated. The detailed contents of the report will be developed along with the agenda for the meeting but should include:

   * Concrete recommendations to those currently implementing or planning to implement systems. What should they definitely do to ensure interoperability moving forward?
   * What tools and expertise are available to help TDWG?
   * Precise recommendations for testing of potential new technologies. What do we need to know to make further recommendations regarding the way things should be implemented?
   * General recommendations for future research. What areas are there that may harbour threats or opportunities and would therefore benefit from academic research?

---++ Questions That Need Addressing
   * Can we assume that 'most' biodiversity data objects would benefit by being encoded in RDF (including RDFS or OWL) in the future? What are exceptions? What are the implications?
   * Is it technically feasible?
   * What is the effort required to move to an RDF base?
   * If this is a reasonble thing to do how do we move from the current XML Schema based standards to RDF based standards?
   * How do we manage the use of common ontologies/vocabularies within such an architecture?
   * What services and protocols are required beyond LSID resolution? How do we integrate search/query behaviours with LSID resolution services?

There are serveral development teams waiting for the outputs of the TAG-1 meeting. It is therefore important that the meeting occurs as soon as possible. If you feel you could contribute directly to the meeting or there is some one you think should be there please contact me (roger@@tdwg.org) as soon as possible with the following information:
   * Your name and location.
   * Your background as it is relevant to developing a TDWG architecture.
   * The perspective you could bring to the meeting.
   * What you would like to gain from the meeting.
   * Dates when you are available during February, March and April 2006.
   * Your prefered location for the meeting and whether you would be able to host it at your institution.
