-------
%ICON{"warning"}% This vocabulary has been superseded by TaxonOccurrenceLsidVoc. The reasoning is outlined on the TaxonOccurrenceLsidVoc page.

This is a summary of the LSID Vocabulary for OccurrenceRecord. Read LsidVocs  information  on LSID Vocabularies in general.

---++ Further Information

OccurrenceRecords are linked to surrounding objects as illustrated in this rough UML diagram.

---+++ Surely people identify specimens not occurrence records? 

An expert working in a biological collection is superficially looking at specimens and putting names on them but they are actually generating hypotheses that the thing this specimen was taken from was an instance of a particular taxon that occurred in a particular place at a particular time. 

   * The physical specimen in question may have multiple organisms present on it and give rise to multiple occurrence records.
   * The specimen may consist of a blood or tissue sample and is not therefore an instance of the organism.
   * The determination process may be destructive.
   * The specimen may be derived from the organism in the wild (an imprint in rock or a photograph).
   * It may be an n'th generation culture of the original sample.
   * It may be the entire organism.
   * The occurrence of a taxon may only be hypothesized from evidence in two specimens. Fertile material may be gathered at one time of year and vegetative material at another. 
   * It may be indicative of the absence of an organism (e.g. the lack of a parasite) - though this might be contentious.  

---+++ Usage for surveying

There are two possible approaches to using OccurrenceRecord may be used to communicate the results of a survey.
   * The procedure points to the survey procedure. The hasVoucher points to the notebook or other object that the occurrence is original recorded in.
   * The procedure points to a single survey instance.

---+++ Usage for specimens view.

The OccurrenceRecord can be embedded within or linked to from a Specimen record. So a request for a specimen can include its associated OccurrenceRecord. 

---++ Discussion

Visiting the first link under Resources above with a modern web browser will display the documentation for the vocabulary. Please read this first. If you then have any discussion points or questions please add them below.

   * Identification: Roger says above: "Surely people identify specimens not occurrence records?". But field observations that result in no collection event still require identification and produce an OccurrenceRecord.  -- Main.BobMorris - 27 May 2007

   * hasVoucher: the observation community and others accept electronic vouchers, such as images, video and sounds. This doesn't seem to be accomodated in the UML. -- Main.BobMorris - 27 May 2007

   * Locality: the OWL and the XSD seem to support both geocoded and textual locality. However, if I read them correctly, the OWL and XSD for SpecimenLsidVoc seem to support only geocoding. IMO both should support either. But in any case, there is a data integrity issue caused by hasVoucher if an OccurrenceRecord OR hasVoucher Specimen S and OR and S have inconsistent locality data. -- Main.BobMorris - 27 May 2007
