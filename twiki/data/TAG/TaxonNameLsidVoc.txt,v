---++ Ontology: TDWG Taxon Name LSID Ontology
   * *Location:* http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonName
   * *Creator:* Roger Hyam
   * *Publisher:* TDWG Biodiversity Information Standards
   * *Issued:* 2006-11-15
   * *Modified:* $Date: 2006/12/05 14:27:43 $
   * *Version Info:* 0.2 - [SVN $Rev: 749 $]
   * *Description:* Ontology describing the metadata returned for LSIDs that are used for Taxon
         Names. 
   * *Comment:*  FIXME: Not been validated with Wonder Web OWL Ontology
         Validator
      
---++ Class: Taxon Name
   * *Label:* Taxon Name
   * *Comment:*  A scientific biological name. An object that represents a single scientific
         biological name that either is governed by or appears to be governed by one of the
         biological codes of nomenclature. These are not taxa. Taxa, whether accepted or not, are
         represented by TaxonConcept objects. 
   * *Sub Class Of:* http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/Base#Name
   * *Defined By:* http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonName
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* ScientificName complexType
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* ScientificName (as string only)
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name table
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName complexType
---+++ Property: nameComplete
   * *Label:* Name Complete
   * *Comment:*  The complete uninomial, binomial or trinomial name without any authority or
         year components. A label containing the canonical name without authors. For the purposes of
         a TCS signature this field should contain nothing but the text strings representing the
         name itself with no indication of rank or any other qualifiers. 
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* ScientificName/FullScientificNameString
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* ScientificName
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name::FullNameCache
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalName/Simple
---+++ Property: uninomial
   * *Label:* Uninomial
   * *Comment:*  Family, genus, infrafamilial, suprafamilial or other uninomial name. This
         property should be used for any 'single word' names. These include Family, genus,
         infrafamilial, and suprafamilial names. Note that this property should be used for Genus
         names. The genus field should only be used for names below rank of genus. 
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* ScientificName/NameAtomised/*/GenusOrMonomial (but only when NOT
         representing a genus name)
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* ScientificName
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name::SupragenericName (but not used for names at the rank of
         Genus)
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalName/Uninomial
---+++ Property: genusPart
   * *Label:* Genus Part
   * *Comment:*  The genus part of a bi or trinomial name. The name of the genus for names below
         the rank of genus. This property should not be used for names at and above the rank of
         genus. For names at and above genus rank the uninomial property should be used.
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* ScientificName/NameAtomised/*/GenusOrMonomial (but only when
         representing a genus name) 
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* Genus (though this is used of taxonomic placement in DwC)
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name::Genus
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalName/Genus
---+++ Property: infragenericEpithet
   * *Label:* Infrageneric Epithet
   * *Comment:*  The infrageneric part of a binomial name at ranks above species but below
         genus. Names at ranks between species and genus are composed of two words; the genus and
         this infrageneric epithet. This property should therefore always be accompanied by the
         genusPart property. If the infragenericEpithet property is present the uninomial,
         infraspecificEpithet, specificEpithet and subspecificEpithet properties should be absent.
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* ScientificName/NameAtomised/botanical/FirstEpithet (but not in names at
         rank of species and below) or ScientificName/NameAtomised/Zoological/Subgenus or
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Bacterial/Subgenus 
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name::GenusSubdivisionEpi
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalName/InfragenericEpithet
---+++ Property: specificEpithet
   * *Label:* Specific Epithet
   * *Comment:*  The specific epithet part of a binomial or trinomial name at or below the rank
         of species. Names at ranks of species and below are composed of two or three words; the
         genus epithet, the specific epithet and possibly an infraspecific epithet. This property
         should therefore always be accompanied by the genusPart property. If the specificEpithet
         property is present the uninomial and infragenericEpithet properties should be absent.
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* ScientificName/NameAtomised/botanical/FirstEpithet (but not in names
         above the rank of species) or ScientificName/NameAtomised/Zoological/SpeciesEpithet or
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Bacterial/SpeciesEpithet or
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Viral/ViralSpeciesDesignation 
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* SpecificEpithet
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name::SpeciesEpi
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalName/SpecificEpithet
---+++ Property: infraspecificEpithet
   * *Label:* Infraspecific Epithet
   * *Comment:*  The infraspecific epithet part of a trinomial name below the rank of species.
         Names at ranks below species are composed of three words; the genus epithet, the specific
         epithet and an infraspecific epithet. This property should therefore always be accompanied
         by the genusPart property and a specificEpithet property. If the specificEpithet property
         is present the uninomial and infragenusPart properties should be absent. 
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:*  ScientificName/NameAtomised/Bacterial/SubspeciesEpithet or
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Botanical/InfraspecificEpithet or
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Zoological/SubSpeciesEpithet
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* InfraspecificEpithet
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name::InfraSpeciesEpi
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalName/InfraspecificEpithet
---+++ Property: cultivarNameGroup
   * *Label:* Cultivar Name or Cultivar Group Name
   * *Comment:*  The cultivar or related name governed by ICNCP. The name of the Cultivar,
         Cultivar Group, grex, convar or graft chimera under the International Code for the
         Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants. Only include here the string of the name. i.e. omit the
         single quotes around cultivar names, the word Group that denotes cultivar group and the +
         sign used in chimeras. These symbols can be added in later on the basis of the rank of the
         name. For example the use of the word 'Group' is language dependent.
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:*  ScientificName/NameAtomised/Botanical/CultivarGroupName and
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Botanical/CultivarName 
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* InfraspecificEpithet
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name::CultivarGroupName and Name::CultivarName
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalName/CultivarNameGroup
---+++ Property: authorship
   * *Label:* Authorship
   * *Comment:*  The full author string used for this name. The full code-appropriate author
         team string for this name at this rank. Use this property for all names including both
         original combinations and new combinations of bi and trinomial names (where some of the
         authors may be in brackets). If the TaxonName instance contains any details about
         authorship a representation of them should be included in this property.
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:*  ScientificName/NameAtomised/Bacterial/AuthorTeamAndYear or
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Botanical/AuthorTeam (FIXME: Does this include the
         AuthorTeamParenthesis?) or
         [ScientificName/NameAtomised/Zoological/AuthorTeamOriginalAndYear and
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Zoological/AuthorTeamParenthesisAndYear and
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Zoological/CombinationAuthorTeamAndYear (FIXME: need
         clarification as to which of these occur))] 
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* AuthorYearOfScientificName
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name:AuthorTeamFk -> AuthorTeam::AuthorTeamCache
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalAuthorship/Simple
---+++ Property: basionymAuthorship
   * *Label:* Basionym Authorship
   * *Comment:*  A string representing the authors of the basionym of this name. This represents
         the authors of the basionym. It is the part of authorship that is typically included in
         brackets. The brackets should be omitted. A year may be included as is common in citing
         names governed by the ICZN. This property is only used for names that are new combinations.
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:*  ScientificName/NameAtomised/Botanical/AuthorTeamParenthesis or
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Zoological/AuthorTeamParenthesisAndYear 
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name:BasAuthorTeamFk -> AuthorTeam::AuthorTeamCache
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalAuthorship/BasionymAuthorship/Simple
---+++ Property: combinationAuthorship
   * *Label:* Combination Authorship
   * *Comment:*  A string representing the authors of this combination of the name. This
         represents the authors of the new combination of this name. The authors who come after the
         brackets in the traditional way of citing botanical names. These authors are not usually
         cited in zoology though the ICZN recommends that they should be included (Art.51G). A year
         may be included. See also note under year property. This property is only used for names
         that are new combinations.
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:*  ScientificName/NameAtomised/Botanical/AuthorTeam (when
         AuthorTeamParenthesis present?)
         ScientificName/NameAtomised/Zoological/CombinationAuthorTeamAndYear 
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name:AuthorTeamFk -> AuthorTeam::AuthorTeamCache (only when
         Name:BasAuthorTeamFk is present?)
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalAuthorship/CombinationAuthorship/Simple
---+++ Property: year
   * *Label:* Publication Year
   * *Comment:*  The year of publication of this name. This is the year this name was published.
         If it is a new combination of the name then it is the year of publication of the
         combination not the basionym. It should be the same as the year given in the publishedIn
         property. In zoology the place of first publication of a new combination is rarely given as
         it is not considered a nomenclatural act unless it leads to homonymy. For new combinations
         of names in zoology it may therefore be inappropriate to supply this property or the
         publishedIn, combintationAuthorship or combintationAuthorTeam properties. The main role of
         this property is to aid disambiguation where author strings may be confusing. This property
         is not restricted to a date type as feedback from TCS suggested that this restriction was
         inappropriate.
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* No equivalent.
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No equivalent.
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* No equivalent other than through publication.
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/Year
---+++ Property: rankString
   * *Label:* Rank String
   * *Comment:* The taxonomic rank of this name as a string. A string representation of the rank
         of this name. It is highly recommended that the rank property be used along with this one
         unless the correct rank is not available in the rank vocabulary. No direct equivalent in
         TCS but is string version of ScientificName/Rank. Requested by data suppliers. 
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* No equivalent??
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* Only below species with InfraspecificRank
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name::RankFk -> Rank::Rank
   * *TCS Equivalent:* No direct equivalent in TCS but is string version of ScientificName/Rank.
         Requested by data suppliers.
---+++ Property: typificationString
   * *Label:* Typified String
   * *Comment:* A string representing the typification of this name. See also the typifiedBy
      property.
   * *Range:* http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* NomenclaturalTypeDesignations/NomenclaturalTypeDesignation/TypeStatus
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* No equivalent other than through Facts tables?
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/Typification/Simple
---+++ Property: authorTeam
   * *Label:* Author Team
   * *Comment:* A breakdown of the authors who published this name including both basionym and
         combination authors (if any).
   * *Range:* http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/Base#Actorhttp://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/Base#Actor
   * *ABCD Equivalent:*  No equivalent of an author team break down. 
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name:AuthorTeamFk and Name:BasAuthorTeamFk 
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/CanonicalAuthorship/
---+++ Property: nomenclaturalCode
   * *Label:* Nomenclatural Code
   * *Comment:*  The nomenclatural code that governs this name. By definition all taxon names
         are governed by one of the codes of nomenclature. These include ICBN, ICZN, ICNCP and
         others.
   * *Range:* #NomenclaturalCodeTerm#NomenclaturalCodeTerm
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* Indicated by whether bacterial, botanical, zoological or viral name
         constructs are used.
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* Indicated by Kingdom field
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName@@nomenclaturalCode
---+++ Property: hasBasionym
   * *Label:* Has Basionym
   * *Comment:*  The basionym of this name if it is a new combination. The current name is a
         recombination (comb. nov.) of the name pointed to and the name pointed to is not, itself, a
         recombination.
   * *Range:* #TaxonName#TaxonName
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* No direct equivalent. May be indicated in RelName table.
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/Basionym
---+++ Property: basionymFor
   * *Label:* Basionym For
   * *Comment:*  Relationship between a basionym and a new combination of the name. 
   * *Range:* #TaxonName#TaxonName
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* No direct equivalent. May be indicated in RelName table.
   * *TCS Equivalent:* No equivalent in TCS but is inverse of ScientificName/Basionym 
---+++ Property: rank
   * *Label:* Rank
   * *Comment:* The taxonomic rank of this name. This is a link to an instance of TaxonomicRank.
         Compare with the rankString property.
   * *Range:* http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonRank#TaxonRankTermhttp://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonRank#TaxonRankTerm
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* No equivalent??
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No direct equivalent but see rankString
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* Name::RankFk
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/Rank
---+++ Property: hasAnnotation
   * *Label:* Has Annotation
   * *Comment:*  Association between a name and the notes that it may have. Often notes relate
         to other names such as replacement names.
   * *Range:* #NomenclaturalNote#NomenclaturalNote
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* RelName, NomStatus and NomStatusRel tables
   * *TCS Equivalent:* complexType NomenclaturalNoteType
---+++ Property: typifiedBy
   * *Label:* Typified By
   * *Comment:* A NomenclaturalType that typifies this name. An instance of NomenclaturalType
         that contains a type specimen or name for this name. See also note with NomenclaturalType
         class. See also the typificationString property.
   * *Range:* #NomenclaturalType#NomenclaturalType
   * *ABCD Equivalent:* NomenclaturalTypeDesignations/NomenclaturalTypeDesignation
   * *DarwinCore Equivalent:* No equivalent
   * *Berlin Model Equivalent:* No equivalent other than through Facts tables?
   * *TCS Equivalent:* ScientificName/Typification
---++ Class: Nomenclatural Type
   * *Label:* Nomenclatural Type
   * *Comment:* A type name or specimen. Typification can be complex to represent. On the one
         hand a type is a property of a TaxonName that is created at the time the name is published.
         But it needs to exist as a structure so that the type of type can be indicated. On the
         other hand a type can be the result of a later typification event - almost like a
         nomenclatural note. This object can therefore be used in two ways. It can be the target of
         the 'type' property in a TaxonName object (in which case the typeOf property may be
         ommitted) or it can be used as a free standing object with its own ID and the typeOf
         property used to indicate which TaxonName this is a type of - this is more likely scenario
         in a the case of a leptotypification event. Equivalent to TCS ScientificName/Typification 
   * *Sub Class Of:* http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/Base#BaseThing
   * *Defined By:* http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonName
---+++ Property: typeName
   * *Label:* Type Name
   * *Comment:* The name that is the type. TaxonNames at ranks above species level are typified
         by the NAME of a lower taxon. Ultimately, by following the chain of type names, all names
         resolve to a type species and so a type specimen. This property is mutually exclusive with
         typeSpecimen. A name can't have both. Equivalent to TCS
         ScientificName/Typification/TypeName. 
   * *Range:* #TaxonName#TaxonName
---+++ Property: typeSpecimen
   * *Label:* Type Specimen
   * *Comment:* The specimen that is the type. TaxonNames at ranks of family and below are

   * *Definition:* An epitype is a specimen or illustration selected to serve as an
         interpretative type when any kind of holotype, lectotype, etc. is demonstrably ambiguous
         and cannot be critically identified for purposes of the precise application of the name of
         a taxon (see Art. ICBN 9.7, 9.18). An epitype supplements, rather than replaces existing
         types. [Bot./Bio.]
---+++ Term: ExType

         distinct stages in the life cycle, which together form the type in an extant species of
         protistan [ICZN Article 72.5.4]. A hapantotype, while a series of individuals, is a
         holotype that must not be restricted by lectotype selection. If an hapantotype is found to
         contain individuals of more than one species, however, components may be excluded until it
         contains individuals of only one species [ICZN Article 73.3.2]. [Zoo.]
---+++ Term: Holotype
   * *Label:* Holotype
   * *Definition:* The one specimen or other element used or designated by the original author
         at the time of publication of the original description as the nomenclatural type of a
         species or infraspecific taxon. A holotype may be 'explicit' if it is clearly stated in the
         originating publication or 'implicit' if it is the single specimen proved to have been in
         the hands of the originating author when the description was published.
      [Zoo./Bot./Bio.]
---+++ Term: Iconotype
   * *Label:* Iconotype
   * *Definition:* A drawing or photograph (also called 'phototype') of a type specimen. Note:
         the term "iconotype" is not used in the ICBN, but implicit in, e. g., ICBN Art. 7 and 38.
         [Zoo./Bot.]
---+++ Term: Isotype
   * *Label:* Isotype
   * *Definition:* An isotype is any duplicate of the holotype (i. e. part of a single
         gathering made by a collector at one time, from which the holotype was derived); it is
         always a specimen (ICBN Art. 7). [Bot.]

---+++ Term: Lectotype
   * *Label:* Lectotype
   * *Definition:* A specimen or other element designated subsequent to the publication of the
         original description from the original material (syntypes or paratypes) to serve as
         nomenclatural type. Lectotype designation can occur only where no holotype was designated
         at the time of publication or if it is missing (ICBN Art. 7, ICZN Art. 74). [Zoo./Bot.] --
         Note: the BioCode defines lectotype as selection from holotype material in cases where the
         holotype material contains more than one taxon [Bio.].
---+++ Term: Neotype
   * *Label:* Neotype
   * *Definition:* A specimen designated as nomenclatural type subsequent to the publication of
         the original description in cases where the original holotype, lectotype, all paratypes and
         syntypes are lost or destroyed, or suppressed by the (botanical or zoological) commission
         on nomenclature. In zoology also called "Standard specimen" or "Representative specimen".
         [Zoo./Bot./Bio.]
---+++ Term: Paratype
   * *Label:* Paratype
   * *Definition:* All of the specimens in the type series of a species or infraspecific taxon
         other than the holotype (and, in botany, isotypes). Paratypes must have been at the
         disposition of the author at the time when the original description was created and must
         have been designated and indicated in the publication. Judgment must be exercised on
         paratype status, for only rarely are specimens explicitly cited as paratypes, but usually
         as "specimens examined," "other material seen", etc. [Zoo./Bot.]
---+++ Term: Paralectotype

---+++ Term: Topotype
   * *Label:* Topotype
   * *Definition:* One or more specimens collected at the same location as the type series
         (type locality), regardless of whether they are part of the type series. Topotypes are not
         regulated by the botanical or zoological code. Also called "locotype".
      [Zoo./Bot.]
---+++ Term: Type
   * *Label:* Type
   * *Definition:* a) A specimen designated or indicated any kind of type of a species or
         infraspecific taxon. If possible more specific type terms (holotype, syntype, etc.) should
         be applied. b) the type name of a name of higher rank for taxa above the species rank.
         [General]
---+++ Term: NotAType
