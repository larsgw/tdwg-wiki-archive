This page is to discuss what modeling constructs should be used in building a TDWG ontology or SemanticHub application.

---++ Constructs We Should Use

---+++ Classes

---+++ Properties of Classes

---+++ Literal Values of Properties of Classes
How detailed should this be and when do they become data types...

---+++ Ranges of Values of Properties of Classes
Range here is meant in the RDFS sense.

   * Please elaborate, not everyone knows what that is. Gregor

---++ Constructs We Should NOT Use

   * None

---+++ Properties As Top Level Objects

Like RDF - properties can belong to any class.

   * Please elaborate. Gregor

---++ Undecided
