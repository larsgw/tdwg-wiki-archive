This is a reply to Main.GregorHagedorn to address his comments on WhyWeShouldNotUseLSIDs and UsePURLsAsGUIDs.

Instead of replacing LSID by PURL, you could use an LSID HTTP proxy, such as the [[http://lsid.biopathways.org/resolver/][Biopathways LSID Resolver]] to allow clients that are only aware of HTTP to resolve LSIDs without any additional software.

Such a proxy accepts HTTP GET/POST requests following some well-known rules ([[http://lsid.biopathways.org/resolver/weblinks.shtml][such as these]]), resolves the LSID passed as a parameter, and returns either the data or metadata associated with the LSID to the original client.

The result is very similar, if not equivalent, to what you would have with PURL, without having to give up on the benefits of LSIDs.

Besides the proxy I mentioned for LSID, there are well developed HTTP proxies for both DOI and ARK as well. There is really good documentation about the DOI bridge on the DOI site.

Gregor: My question is: If I have descriptive data expressing:

   * taxon urn:lsid:authority.net:fungi:Species1 has character urn:lsid:authority.net:character:leaf-shape with state urn:lsid:authority.net:state:elliptical

can I then use an automatic reasoner to understand that this entails

   * taxon urn:lsid:authority.net:fungi:Genus1 has character urn:lsid:authority.net:character:shape-of-leaf-like-structure with state urn:lsid:authority.net:state:roundish

To answer the query: Which genus contains species with roundish leaf-like structures (regardless whether true leaves, cladodes, etc.)?

As I understand from what we learnt at TAG-1 this is not expected, because RDF/OWL cannot do this. If I have an http proxy - how will the ontology reasoner learn to use it, if I express the knowledge in terms of LSIDs?
