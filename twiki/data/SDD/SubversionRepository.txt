The SDD Subversion Repository at http://aardvark.cs.umb.edu/svn/sdd has three branches. Note that if you visit that URL with a browser, you see all the files but none of the metadata which shows the revision structure. For that you need a Subversion client. New to Subversion? Then see also SubversionReleaseProcedures. The branches are :

   * _trunk_ - the branch in which _ALL_ stock development is done.
   * _releases_ - the branch in which all named releases are done. In general there should never be more than one revision of any released version, because development happens in the trunk by convention.
   * _branches_ - This is a special branch (sorry for the dual use of the word "branch"). It carries anything which is a diversion from the main development, which may, or may not later be merged back. It should be used sparingly. The only present use for it is to hold revisions of a version of SDD which has unreleased topics for discussion, indicated in the schema with elements named with leading underbar. Those underbar elements are generally removed from anything in the trunk or in released versions, but for historical reasons, that is not the case for release /releases/SDD1.1b11

There is a snapshop of the tree at the point of SDD1.1-RC1 in SubversionTreeSnapshot

http://aardvark.cs.umb.edu/svn/sandbox is available to registered developers for testing their clients.

Main.BobMorris: One feature of !WebDAV _not_ used by Subversion is to make remote files appear in your network file system in the "Web folders" explorer tree. Instead, SVN has  the notion of a "working copy" on your own file system of any revision of interest to you. 

SVN checkout consists of creating a copy by starting with an empty folder on your own file system whose name is of your own choosing. With the !TortoiseSVN client installed on your Windows system, right click on this new folder and select "SVN Checkout". The dialogue that results will allow you to specify the repository folder you wish to check out, in this case probably !http://aardvark.cs.umb.edu/svn/sdd/trunk. When you complete this dialogue, two things will happen: (a) your new folder will contain copies of the files from the repository and (b) the folder and its files will have icon overlays on them that indicate their SVN status, either "current" with the revision you checked out, or "modified" modified from the revision you checked out. See the !TortoiseSVN client manual for details. The name of your checkout folder is immaterial to SVN. The particular repository and revision you checked out is kept in a file named .svn inside that folder created by the checkout and managed by your SVN client. (Don't mess with it!). I create my initially empty checkout folders all as subfolders in a folder named something like svnCheckout so I can find them easily.

If you check out !http://aardvark.cs.umb.edu/svn/sdd instead of !http://aardvark.cs.umb.edu/svn/sdd/trunk you will find that you get the entire sdd repository with all its branches. That may ultimately prove confusing to novice !TortoiseSVN users and is not recommended until you get a feel for what !TortoiseSVN is remembering about your use of the repository. Because our policy is that development normally takes place in the trunk, it is best to have nothing else in sight in your working copies until you know how to deal with checkins to multiple repositories.(See the "Switch" command in the !TortoiseSVN manual). -- Main.BobMorris - 15 May 2006

Note 1: If you are working through a firewall, subversion under Windows will *not* read the system internet connection settings; you probably must repeat the firewall proxy definition inside subversion (context menu on any folder, then TortoiseSVN, Settings, then in dialog left side tree: Network). -- Gregor

Note 2: You may manually set up a !WebDAV connection to the repository to simply browse the entire folder structure: In the Windows Explore (not Internet explorer!), under network, use the entry "Add Network Place" which is usually first among the files, enter the repository url. You should then find this folder under "Web folders" in the explorer tree.  Note that this is *not how SVN works*! SVN uses a folder on the local file system as explained above. You will not find the subversion context menu when working on the !WebDAV connected folders! (Gregor/Bob)
