<h3>History and Context of SDD</h3>

In the 1980's, TDWG endorsed the DELTA (Descriptive Language for Taxonomy) format as a standard for representing taxonomic descriptions. The SDD subgroup was established in 1998 to develop new, program-independent, non-proprietary standards based on current data interchange techniques.

The SDD group has met many times since 1998 and conducted discussions by email list and Wiki pages. It has considered the requirements of a wide variety of existing programs that manage, produce, and consume biological descriptions, as well as incorporating new ideas that some developers of these programs plan to implement in the near future.

The SDD group began discussing issues and scoping the standard through an email discussion group established in November 1999 (see the SDD email list archives). This discussion resulted in broad participation, but as a result of a wide range of expectations and approaches no substantial progress or convergence was achieved. The most effective strategy since 2001 has been found to be face-to-face meetings. These meetings helped to focus and take uncertainties into account, which could not be purely resolved by logical argument.

The major meetings so far were: Canberra, Nov. 2001; Sao Paulo, Oct. 2002; Paris, Feb. 2003; Lisbon, October 2003; Berlin, May 2004; Christchurch, Oct. 2004; St. Petersburg, Sept. 2005, and Berlin, April 2006. Over 60 people contributed to these discussions. However, the help, criticism and energy of Jacob Asiedu, Nicolas Bailly, Damian Barnier, Donald Hobern, Trevor Paterson, Guillaume Rousse, and Steve Shattuck are especially acknowledged.
