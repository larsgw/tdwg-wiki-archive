---++DELTA and SDD (= SDD for DELTA experts)

---+++Synopsis

SDD is not simply DELTA expressed in xml. We try to deal with many problems the DELTA users and the developer team themselves (see M. J. Dallwitz, T. A. Paine, and E. J. Zurcher (1993 onwards, [[http://biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/www/proposal.htm][1999]], [[http://delta-intkey.com/www/proposal.htm][2005]]) Proposed New Features for the DELTA System)) identified as deficits in DELTA. The SDD proposal is explicitly design to be used as a replacement for the DELTA standard. The following documents here are intended to help DELTA experts in writing software to migrate DELTA applications to SDD conforming applications.

---+++Why not keep DELTA?
   * [[DeltaComplexity][Complexity of SDD versus DELTA]] (... DELTA is not as simple as many believe) 
   * [[DeltaDirectives][DELTA directives]] (problems with directives and need for a new general format) 
   * See also [[http://www.diversitycampus.net/Projects/TDWG-SDD/Primer/SDD_FAQ.htm][Question in the Primer FAQ]] (@@ FixMe: needs relinking once Primer is on the Wiki!) 

---+++Understanding SDD from a DELTA perspective
   * [[DeltaBroadFeatureMapping][Broad comparison of DELTA and SDD features ]] (which DELTA and SDD features are related?) 
   * [[DeltaToBDI.SDD][Exporting DELTA to SDD]] (more detailed discussion of the relationship between DELTA and SDD features)
