In SDD1.1RC2 !ConceptStates cannot be referenced in other Concepts.  Same applies to modifiers.

This is by design, to keep the design simpler. Supporting cross references of states and modifiers would require parallel mechanisms for literal (direct) state or modifier definitions, and references.

I suggest to change this in the next version, if use cases that make this a logical requirement are presented.
