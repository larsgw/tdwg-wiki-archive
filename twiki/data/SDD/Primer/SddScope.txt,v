---++SDD Part 0: Introduction and Primer to the SDD Standard 

---+++3.19 Scope of descriptions

---++++3.19.1 What is scoping?

While an SDD instance document may contain more than one set of descriptions for different purposes, the group of taxa described within each description is not set and may contain any subset of [[TaxonNames][&lt;TaxonNames&gt;]] or [[SpecimenNames][&lt;Specimens&gt;]]. The scope element is applicable within any element nested within &lt;Dataset&gt; ([[NaturalLanguageDescriptions][natural language descriptions]], [[CodedDescription][coded descriptions]], and [[DichotomousKeys][dichotomous keys]]) and allows a definition of the entities covered by each distinct description. 

When used on &lt;Dataset&gt;, &lt;Scope&gt; defines the (taxonomic, ecological, geographic) scope for all keys or descriptions in the entire dataset, e.g. for a key to Australian desert grasses. In a CodedDescription, the &lt;Scope&gt; element could be used to define a description as refering to mandibles of immature male Lycanthropes of Wisconsin.

A simple SDD instance document for defining scope has the basic structure shown below.

%ATTACHURL%/scope.gif

The scope of a dataset may be defined with reference to taxa, specimens, geographic names, etc. Multiple taxon names may be used to express ambiguities or groupings for which no higher taxon name exists (e. g., species from a geographical region). Taxon names may include a &lt;citation&gt; to the original source of the scope definition. Specimen scopes refer to the original physical object and may include reference to a geographical locality.

The scope of a dataset may be defined with reference to taxa or specimens.

---+++++4.10.2.1 &lt;TaxonName&gt;

Refers to taxon names = names for classes of individuals. Multiple taxon names may express ambiguities or an operational grouping for which no higher taxon name exists (e. g., species from a geographical region). May include a &lt;citation&gt;.

---+++++4.10.2.2 &lt;Citation&gt;

Source citation(s) for the object for which a scope is defined. If no Citation is given it is assumed that the compiler or editor of the data is the original source of information.

---+++++4.10.2.3 &lt;Specimen&gt;

Refers to an individual physical object, which may be a collected and preserved object or an observation. Specimens may be derived from other specimens (a microscopic preparation, a picture derived from an observation). Conflicts may occur between the taxon names defined in scope and taxon names from Specimen identifications; these need to be resolved manually. May include a &lt;GeographicArea&gt;.

---+++++4.10.2.4 &lt;GeographicArea&gt;

Descriptions may be specific to a geographic region. A taxon may have different morphology, molecular markers, etc. in different regions.

---+++++4.10.2.5 &lt;Part&gt;

A description may cover only parts an organism, ('inflorescence', 'roots').

---+++++4.10.2.6 &lt;Stage&gt;

Developmental concepts ('larval stage', 'adult', etc.)

---+++++4.10.2.7 &lt;Sex&gt;

Male, female, etc.

---+++++4.10.2.8 &lt;OtherConcept&gt;

Other concepts that may define the scope of a description.

There are three functional groups within the element &lt;Scope&gt;. Elements defining taxa, elements defining specimens, and elements specifying the specifics of each recorded event..
