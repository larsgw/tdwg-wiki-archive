Bob: Here list topics for discussion by their name (see WhatToDoWithElementsMarkedForDiscussion) as in SDD1.1b8
   * ColorRangeSampleData
      * Gregor: I believe the element corresponding to the type is !SampleData/SamplingEvent/SamplingUnit/__ColorRange. I am not sure what the issue is - whether to include it or not? Last time you convinced me that color ranges, although desirable may be to complicated to be appropriately dealt with in the current proposal. I therefore marked with double underscore.
      * Bob: I meant to put my points on record, which I have now done, referencing the type ColorRangeSampleData. I agree that the ..../_ColorRange should come out for now.


   * Gregor: I believe !TaxonHierarchy/TaxonHierarchyType should be moved to !TaxonHierarchy/Specification/TaxonHierarchyType
   * %RED%Bob: How critical is this? I thought we agreed that the rearranging was all frozen for 1dot1beta8.%ENDCOLOR%
