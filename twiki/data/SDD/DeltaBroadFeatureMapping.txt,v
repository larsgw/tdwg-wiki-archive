---++Broad comparison of DELTA and SDD features

---+++Synopsis

The primary object types of SDD are shown in a tabular display and annotations are provided pointing to relations and differences with the [[http://biodiversity.bio.uno.edu/delta/][DELTA]] format. See also the overview [[DELTAandBDI.SDD][SDD for DELTA experts]].

---+++Object classes of SDD

Note: the left side represents first-class and some second-class objects in SDD. Names in bracketed are not directly represented in SDD but are used to group objects.

 <b>Characters</b></td>
<td rowspan="2">The single flat character list containing states is relatively similar in SDD and DELTA. The character definition in SDD also contains information from the DELTA !*CHAR TYPES, !*KEY STATES (= SDD Mappings) directives. In contrast to DELTA, the order of characters in SDD is not informative and is instead defined exclusively in the character trees. This enables different character sequences for different reporting purposes and splitting characters into multiple files or reusing characters from different terminologies.<br />
Representation/Detail with role="Description" or role="Normative" enables to supply simple textual definitions and is related to the DELTA !*CHAR NOTES directive.</td></tr>

<td>These define operational hierarchies for listing characters in a character definition report, in interactive keys, or in natural language reports. The nodes may be labeled by reference to descriptive concepts. Character trees define both a hierarchy and an order for the unstructured and unordered list of characters.<br />
In contrast to DELTA, SDD can express multiple character hierarchies, and also alternative character sequences (order in which characters are arranged) by using multiple character trees.<br />
Furthermore, when used for natural language reporting (equivalent to the CSIRO DELTA TONAT command), the format and structure of the natural language description is defined here as well (!*LINK CHAR, !*NEW PARAGRAPHS AT CHARACTERS, !*Replace Semicolon By Comma, etc. directives)</td></tr>

<b><a href="SDD_S3_Terminology.html">Modifiers</a></b></td>
<td>DELTA uses free-form comments for probability, frequency ("rarely"), degree ("strongly", "weakly"), timing ("when mature"), location ("at the base"), etc. modifiers. DELTA comments have to be translated into a second language at every place they are used. In SDD all modifiers are centrally managed and translated. Probability, frequency, and by-misinterpretation further provide an analytical description.</td></tr>

<b><a href="SDD_S3_Terminology.html">Characters</a></b></td>
<td>The single flat character list containing states is relatively similar in SDD and DELTA. The character definition in SDD contains the information from the DELTA *CHAR TYPES, *KEY STATES (= SDD Mappings) directives. Note that in contrast to DELTA, the sequence of characters in SDD is not informative and is instead defined exclusively in concept trees. This allows different character sequences for different reporting purposes.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="border:2px solid green;">
<b><a href="SDD_S3_Terminology.html">Concept Trees</a></b></td>
<td>Concept trees can express basic terminological concepts (structural hierarchy, property hierarchy, methods) not available in DELTA, as well as operational hierarchies for listing characters in a character definition report, in interactive keys, or in natural language reports. They define both a hierarchy (in DELTA compare the single level hierarchies *CHAR HEADINGS for character list report, *ITEM SUBHEADINGS for natural language reporting, *DEFINE CHARACTERS for Intkey) and a sequence. In contrast to DELTA, SDD can express multiple character sequences if desired. Furthermore, when used for natural language reporting (equivalent to the CSIRO DELTA TONAT command), the format and structure of the natural language description is defined here as well (*LINK CHAR, *NEW PARAGRAPHS AT CHARACTERS, *Replace Semicolon By Comma, etc. directives)</td></tr>
