In RC2, it is not clear where one can put a caption on a <nop>MediaObject

!MediaObject/Representation/Detail[role="caption"].

Caption is one of the possible roles of a detail-representation of an object and part of the basic !ObjectPattern used. Strictly, a caption is different from a description or abstract of an object, because it is intended to be shown with the object, rather than instead of it. In practice, however, the distinction between description and caption is rather weak, and only very rarely are separate image captions and image descriptions created.
