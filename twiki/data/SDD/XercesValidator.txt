This is a tool that validates an xml document against a schema using  xerces parser.

-- Main.JacobAsiedu - 12 May 2006
 * [[%ATTACHURL%/validator.zip][validator.zip]]: XML validator

Gregor notes (not for hackers, but perhaps for other biologists): 
   * The Xerces version used is 2.8.0, see http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/
   * You must rename the validate.bat_REMOVE_ME to validate.bat. 
   * Also note that you *must* use an instance document (this is said in the readme, but easily overlooked). Use, e.g., SDD-Test-Simple.xml - SDD.xsd will not work.
   * When validation was ok, the command line will say "Validation was successful!!" -- Note that looking into the errors.log file is confusing because that one will accumulate the messages, thus is will still say: validation failed (i.e. from the previous run).
