*The preferred method of discussion is now the SDD Wiki, but we occasionally still use the mailing list.*

*NEW:* Along with other TDWG on-line resources, the TDWG-SDD mailing list has now been moved to the new TDWG servers. This message has been sent using the new list to tdwg-sdd@lists.tdwg.org. The new web address for the list is:
   * [[http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-sdd]]
No action needs to be taken, except that registered users may post to this list by sending email to:
   * tdwg-sdd@lists.tdwg.org

We thank the University of Kansas Natural History Museum and Biodiversity Research Center, Jim Beach and Rob Dewhirst in particular for kindly and efficiently running this list for us!
