(This is a discussion area based on the previous extensive discussions in person and on the email list, documented in NameForStandard.)

I think we just have to come out with some really personal choices. I held myself back partly because I did like the idea (first raised by Chuck) to forge a family of multiple tdwg standards that have a common naming pattern. I proposed this in the plenary summary discussion in Lisbon (twdg 2003) but the other groups were not very enthusiastic. So, we are free to choose.

Anyway, my preferences are:

1. <nop>DescriptionML - we can correctly grab a broad are, SDD is not restricted to biology<br/>
2. <nop>SDD - Structured Descriptive Data<br/>
3. <nop>CompL (spoken compel) - comparative data language<br/>
4. <nop>xDelta - to honor Delta<br/>

(or <nop>ComeOn, <nop>ComparativE Ontology Notation?)

Please add your hitlists, maybe something will emerge!
