---+Skype Meeting for 2005-12-08 9am UTC

---++ Report Review Process
   * What process would we like to see followed?
   * How do we handle the feedback? Do we write updated reports or do the TDWG Executive add addenda, take actions, make recommendations?

---++ GUID Related

---+++ Overlapping of GUID2 and TAG1?
How do we manage to get the GUIDs deliverables done as a firm base for architecture work and not let TAG discussions get in the way of GUID decision making. Suggestion - Roger - you have to write a charter for the TAG!

---+++ GUID + RDF + GML
   * Are GML and RDF complementary or competitors?
   * How to introduce RDF/SW approach to data modeling in GUID?
   * How to make transition from existing knowledge in XML Schema?
   * Inventory of deployed resources (DiGIR + ABCD, TCS, SDD) and relationship to RDF approach

---+++ GUID Meeting Arrangements
   * Discuss Agenda (including Donald's suggestions). 
   * Current head count. Should we invite 4 more people or should we keep numbers low? Financial considerations.
   * Break-out groups are going to be necessary for this size groups - who chairs them and what problems do they address?
   * What roles should Donald, Ricardo an Roger play?
   * What outcomes do we NEED?

---++ Documentation of current standards
Should we offer to pay SDD, ABCD and TCS teams to produce documentation in correct format?
   * Yes, as long as we have templates for them to follow.
   * If we pay, they are contracts (or meetings but I don't think this task can be done at a meeting?) so do we know WHO would achieve requirements?

---++ 'Old' Standards 
   * Process group responsibility? Probably not.
   * Are they being used?
   * Lower priority (establish the process we need and get all on track, then go back a tidy up as funds/time allows)
