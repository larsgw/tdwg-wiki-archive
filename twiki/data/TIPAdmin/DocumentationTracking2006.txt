|File Formats| Standard |Must|0%| ? |Roger|Could need much discussion.|
|Layout Template| Standard |Must|0%|? |Roger|May need discussion. Hopefully can just copy from another organisation. |
|Cover Page Spec| Standard |Must|0%| ? |Roger|XML Schema doc. Should be un controversial but may end up with people complaining...|
|Copyright Notice| Standard |Must| 0%| ? |Roger?| I will put a very very straw version of this together but we need to find some one to hand ownership to. We at least need to have it checked by some one knowledgable|
|IP Statements| Standard | Must | 0% | ? | Roger? | Not sure where to start with this. Same position as copyright notice.|
|Process | Standard | Must | 0% |2 + production of text | Process Groups | Just a matter of getting the document produced by the process group into the right format to be a standard. | 
|Charters| Standard | Must | 0% |1 | Process Group | If the process group wants to create standards that define what should be in charters then they need to document them properly. Should be really straight forward |
