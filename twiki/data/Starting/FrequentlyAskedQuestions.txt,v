This is a listing of Frequently Asked Questions, compiled by the TDWG community.  If you have another question, please feel free to add it to this list.

---+++What is TDWG all about?

TDWG is robustly explained in the:

   * Getting Started page: http://www.tdwg.org/getting-started/ 
   * About TDWG page: http://www.tdwg.org/about-tdwg/ (and the range of pages listed on the left under that)

---+++How do you pronounce TDWG? (Lynette Woodburn)
   * Lee Belbin: The most common version I have heard is TAD WIG but TEE DEE DUBLYA GEE (where I started!) and TAG WOG have been heard.  
   * Karen Wilson: TADWIG is the most common pronunciation I've heard; TADWOG seems to be much less common now.@
