*Incorrect type for &lt;SpecificEpithet&gt;*

This element needs to be changed to type {ReferenceType} to allowing linking to another !TaxonName when the !TaxonName is a subspecific rank.

*Incorrect element definition for &lt;TaxonConcept&gt;/&lt;Name&gt;*

The notes for this element indicate that it may act as a link to !TaxonName, or represent the name as published.  To allow this the element needs to include the attribute mixed="true".
