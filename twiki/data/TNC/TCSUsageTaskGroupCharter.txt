---+ Purpose
The aim of the Taxon Concept Schema Usability Task group is to promote the understanding and use of TCS.  The group is concerned with the documenting and clarifying issues concerning the usage of TCS, and providing best-practices examples of the usage of TCS.  

---+ Background
The Taxon Concept Schema (version 1.01) was developed by the Taxon Names and Subgroup and ratified in 2005.  Projects are now starting to implement TCS to exchange nomenclatural and concept data, and are encountering issues that decrease the usability of TCS, including clarification of interpretation, schema bugs, and practical limitations of the schema.

---+ Scope

Usability of TCS to exchange taxonomic and nomenclatural data.
The TCS Usability group will have an active interest in the following areas in order to fully describe the areas within their scope.
