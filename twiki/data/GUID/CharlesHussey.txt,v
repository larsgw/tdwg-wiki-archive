@*Name & Contact details:*
*Charles Hussey* 
Library & Information Services,
Natural History Museum, 
Cromwell Road,
London SW7 5BD
United Kingdom

Tel. +44 (0)207 942 5213
e-mail: c.hussey -at- nhm.ac.uk

*Institutional Affiliation:*
Science Data Co-ordinator,
Data and Digital Systems Team,
[[www.nhm.ac.uk][The Natural History Museum]]


*Biodiversity informatics:*
I have been attending TDWG meetings on and off since 1995 and am a member of the CODATA/TDWG Task Group on Access to Biological Collections Data - one of the participants in the original workshop in Santa Barbara.

*Reasons for interest in participation in GUID standards development*
I have been tasked with monitoring the development of GUIDs for specimens and taxonomic names (and taxonomic concepts :-)) and to advise on preparations for their adoption within the NHM. The National Biodiversity Network [[www.nbn.org.uk][www.nbn.org.uk]] also need to plan for their adoption.
