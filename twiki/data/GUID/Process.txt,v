@---+++ Process
The plan for the review process of GUIDs is as follows:

   * Survey of requirements: open call for input and requirements from all areas of biodiversity informatics, including:
      * Data objects requiring GUIDs (specimens; taxon concepts; publications; etc.)
      * Application scenarios (allocatÃ­ng GUIDs; discovering existing GUIDs; resolving GUIDs; etc.)
      * Issues relating to management of GUIDs within distributed databases (avoidance of duplicate GUIDs identifying different objects; handling of multiple GUIDs identifying the same object; persistence of data; etc.)
      * Potential GUID technologies, including advantages and disadvantages of LSIDs and DOIs
   * First workshop (3 days, 1-3 February 2006, at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), Durham, North Carolina, USA) to review requirements and evaluate candidate technologies, and to establish working groups
   * Working groups to resolve outstanding issues (using mailing lists and/or Wikis to support public discussion) and provide recommendations
   * Second workshop (3 days, mid-2006 - location to be defined) to assess recommendations from working groups and to define models and processes for initial implementation
   * Publication of TDWG standards for GUIDs and initial implementation of any central services or software tools required to support them
