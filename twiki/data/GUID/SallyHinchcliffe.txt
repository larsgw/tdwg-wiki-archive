Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew

I am responsible for developing and maintaining a number of systems within Kew, particularly IPNI (the International Plant Names Index). I have also been tasked with eliciting and co-ordinating Kew's response to the issue of GUIDs whether for names, taxon concepts, specimens or anything else
