@---++ Use Case: Finding Data 

----
---+++++ Description
There is a huge amount of 'taxon related' data already available. Eg. the WDC-MARE holds thousands of data sets
which are e.g. species counts, chemical measurements on fossil remains etc.
The data however is only loosely related to taxonomic information, mostly by a taxon name string which is contained in the name of the measured parameter e.g. 'Oxygen Isotope measurement on taxon XY'.
   * Some of these datasets (all WDC data sets) do already have a GUID (DOI) by which taxonomic information could be linked to data and vice versa.
   * Data was either collected by 'non-taxonomists' or taxonomy has not been updated (as this is beyond the scope of such databases) in older data sets. There is a strong need for a link to taxonomic knowledge e.g. by providing a GUID which links to a taxonomic fact sheet or holotype specimen.@
