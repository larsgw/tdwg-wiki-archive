---++ GUID-1 Workshop

[[http://www.nescent.org/main/][NESCent]] is hosting the *First International Workshop on Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) for Biodiversity* on *February 1-3, 2006*. The workshop is organised by the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG - http://www.tdwg.org) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF - http://www.gbif.org).  

This workshop will review potential GUID technologies and then provide recommendations for a development strategy to the TDWG.

---+++ Goals

   * To discuss requirements for globally unique identifiers for biodiversity informatics
   * To start designing a GUID system for biodiversity informatics
   * To adopt an existing GUID technology (LSID, DOI, Handles, ARK)
   * To specicy a prototype of RDF based metadata architecture for demonstrations
   * To form a working group to draft recommendations on GUID infrastructure

----
---+++ General Plan

   * *Day 1* - Plenary presentations, definition of issues, start of discussions
   * *Day 2* - Parallel discussions in 2 groups (names and concepts; specimens and collections) to develop a refined statement of requirements and to consider suitability of candidate technologies
   * *Day 3* - Plenary review, evaluation of findings, review of what is actually agreed, development of plan to address any outstanding issues
