Solutions - Technical

1) Centralized GUID/LSID authority/resolver 
2) Central DNS SRV service -- subdomain assignment within a centralized domain (e.g., fish-names.lsid.tdwg.org; bishop-fish.lsid.tdwg.org)
3) Nothing


#1 is difficult (scalability & reliability) although it has a lot of benefits.

#2 has benefits if we can pre-identify collections of objects that might move.
