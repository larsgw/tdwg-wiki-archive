---++ Use Case: Finding Specimens 

----
---+++++ Description
This is the most basic use case for GUIDs relating to biological specimens or field observations.  

Some example scenarios:

   1.  A taxonomist wishes to retrieve data relating to a specimen referenced in a monograph, including any available images, to determine whether to request a loan of the specimen.
   1.  A researcher has retrieved a sequence from [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html][GenBank]] identified as coming from a particular taxon, but the sequence is more than 1% different from all others for the same taxon.  The researcher wishes to access the specimen to confirm the identification.
