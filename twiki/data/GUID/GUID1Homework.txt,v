@---++ GUID-1 Homework

----
*This page is obsolete - GUID-1 workshop is over!*
----

To make most out of our first workshop, *we require each participant to read some documents and prepare some material* __before we meet__ in Durham. The *homework* consists of the following tasks:

---+++ 1. Review (and update) the GUID Use-Cases
Please review the updated inventory of [[GUIDUseCases][GUID Use-Cases]]. Add any use-cases you believe we should discuss during the meeting.


---+++ 2. Review GUID technologies
Review the basics aspects of each GUID technology under evaluation. Since each participant is likely to be more familiar with one GUID technology, we would like to ask you to *review the basic aspects of other technologies as well*. To facilitate the process, we have prepared a short list of articles (mostly single sections extracted from articles) to get you up to speed (see below). You may also find useful to read the TechnologyComparison page.

---++++ 2.1 LSIDs
The main source of documentation on LSID is the [[http://www.omg.org/docs/dtc/04-05-01.pdf][LSID Specification]]. Please read the following sections:
   1.  Sections 8 and 8.1 - LSID Syntax and Specification
   1.  Section 9 - LSID Resolution Service
   1.  Section 13.3 - Discovering an LSID Resolution Service using DDDS/DNS
You can find LSID related documentation at the [[http://lsid.sourceforge.net/][LSID Homepage]]

---++++ 2.2 Handle System
The Handle System is documented as a set of [[http://www.ietf.org][IETF]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments][RFCs]]. The  *minimal* reading about the Handle System is a set of sections extracted from [[http://www.handle.net/rfc/rfc3651.html][Handle System Namespace and Service Definition - RFC 3651]] below:
   1.  Section 1: Introduction
   1.  Section 2: Handle System Namespace
   1.  Section 3: Handle System Data Model - Read section 3.1 - Handle Value Set only. Skip section 3.2.
   1.  Section 4: Handle System Service Model - Read section 4.1 (you might want to skip the details here). Skip 4.2.
   1.  Section 5: Handle System Operational Model - Read first paragraph only.

That sounds like a lot, but *it is only about 10 pages* (with some nice ASCII art).
If you need more context, here is the [[http://www.handle.net/documentation.html][Homepage for the Handle System documentation]]

---++++ 2.3 DOI
The main source of DOI information is the [[http://www.doi.org/hb.html][DOI Handbook]] or [[http://hdl.handle.net/10.1000/182][doi:10.1000/182]].
Here is the required reading: 
   1.  [[http://www.doi.org/handbook_2000/intro.html#1.4][Section 1.4 - What is a Digital Object Identifier?]]
   1.  [[http://www.doi.org/handbook_2000/intro.html#1.5][Section 1.5 Components of the DOI System]]
   1.  [[http://www.doi.org/handbook_2000/enumeration.html#2.2][Section 2.2 - The structure of a DOI]]
   1.  [[http://www.doi.org/handbook_2000/resolution.html#3.2][Section 3.2 - Simple resolution]]
   1.  [[http://www.doi.org/handbook_2000/resolution.html#3.3][Section 3.3 - Multiple resolution]]
   1.  [[http://www.doi.org/handbook_2000/resolution.html#3.5.1][Section 3.5.1 - Relationship between the DOI System and the Handle System]]
Again, it sounds like a lot, but if you read only what is required, *it is only a few paragraphs*.
Note that the list of sections above is note a comprehensive description of the DOI System. It just gives the reader an overview about DOI and its differences from the Handle System.
For the time challenged I have put these sections into a [[http://biodiv.hyam.net/homework_sections_of_doi_handbook.pdf][single PDF]] (RogerHyam).

---++++ 2.4 General Questions
If you plan on arguing in favor of one or another GUID technology, be prepared to answer the following questions:
   1.  How extensible is the technology?
   1.  How does it handle metadata? How extensible the metadata framework is, i.e, how easy it is to implement a new framework on top of the basic infrastructure?
   1.  What are its strangths?
   1.  What are its weakenesses and how can we work around them (i.e., what if DNS or Handle System Global Registry cease to exist? What are our options?)
   1.  Anything else you might find relevant.

---+++ 3. Additional Reading (Optional)

The following documents are relevant for the planned workshop activities, so please read them if you have time (or you run out of things to read):

---++++ 3.1 Semantic Web, Ontologies, RDF, and OWL
   * [[http://www.co-ode.org/resources/tutorials/intro/slides/OntologyEngineering.ppt][Ontology Engineering]] by Dr. Jeremy Rogers from the University of Manchester
   * [[http://protege.stanford.edu/amia2003/AMIA2003Tutorial.ppt][Developing Medical Informatics Ontologies with ProtÃ©gÃ©]] by Natasha Noy and Samson Tu, from Stanford University
   * [[http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n9/full/nbt1139.html][From XML to RDF: how semantic web technologies will change the design of 'omic' standards]]
   * [[http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/lsid/examples/lsid.pdf][Roderic Page's manuscript]] on LSID, metadata and the Semantic Web
