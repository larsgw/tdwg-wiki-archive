@---++ The Prototyping Working Group

Our community must experiment with LSID technology and Ontology Engineering if we are to implement a production quality LSID system, The working group will develop prototypes of test cases to test aspects of a GUID infrastructure.

The group will develop test LSID resolvers using data objects provided by each domain, such as names, specimens, and concepts. This activity will also help involve (and train) the community in developing appropriate RDF ontologies, leading to concrete recommendations and implementations.

The potential prototypes to be developed are:
   1.  LSID Resolvers for Taxon Names: 
      1.  LSIDResolverForTaxonNamesIPNI
      1.  LSIDResolverForTaxonNamesIF
      1.  LSIDResolverForTaxonNamesUBio
   1.  LSIDResolverForSpecimens
   1.  LSID Resolvers For Taxon Concepts:
      1.  LSIDResolveForTaxonConceptsCoL
   1.  LSIDResolverForObservations
   1.  LSIDResolverForCharacterData
   1.  LSIDResolverForImages
   1.  LSIDResolverMorphbank
   1.  LSIDResolverTdwgStandards
   1.  LSIDScalabilityTesting
   1.  LSIDBasedIntegrationAntsDemo - A project to demonstrate the potential from LSID-based integration of data for a particular group (Ants) - LSIDs, taxonomic lit, specimen, images, names, sequences from Genbank
   1.  LSIDSeekTaxonResolutionServer
   1.  LSIDConformanceTesting
   1.  LSIDResolverForAnalyticalModels

The *taxon names resolver has the highest priority*.

Each prototype will include the following components:
   * Hardware and software (including LSID stack)
   * RDFS/OWL ontology for domain
   * Data mapping between local data store scheme and shared ontology

Other important tasks identified by this group are:
   * Development of ontologies to represent metadata for the various domains. Coordinated by TDWG TAG with help of experienced ontology engineers.

This group will have 3 months to work on the specified tasks before preparing for the second GUID workshop.
