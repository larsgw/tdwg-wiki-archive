---++ Use Case: Tracking Source Records 

----
---+++++ Description
In some situations, aggregators may add value to records harvested from data sources. For example: 
   * a geo-referencing service may assign a geo-reference to a record based its locality description; 
   * a GBIF data cleaning service may correct an error in the record geo-reference; or 
   * an on-line determination system may assign a different determination to a specimen record. 

In those cases, a new record is generated from the original source record. Both the source and derived records can be made available by online data services. It may be difficult to identify whether a record is derived from another. Also, in some analyses using both versions of a data record may yield lower quality results. 

The main difference between this use-case and DetectingDuplicates is that in the later both the source and the duplicate records are essentially the same, thus they can both share the same globally unique identifier. In this use-case, the source and derived records are different because some of the attributes have been changed.
