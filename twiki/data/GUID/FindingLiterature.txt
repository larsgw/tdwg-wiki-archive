---++ Use Case: Finding Literature 

----
---+++++ Description
   * The majority of scientific journals now additionally offer electronical versions (pdf, html) of journal articles or books. Most of these documents do already have a GUID, mostly a DOI. These DOIs can of course be used to link taxon related records to literature. 
   * Currently (to my knowledge from the geoscientific and paleontological literature) some publishers try e.g.to link from taxonomic keywords to an online authority such as ITIS. This could be replaced by using GUIDs as references.
