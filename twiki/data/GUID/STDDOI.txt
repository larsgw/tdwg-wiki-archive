---++ Publication and Citation of Scientific Primary Data

"Publication and Citation of Scientific Primary Data" (STD-DOI) is a project funded by the German Science Foundation. 
Its aim is to make primary scientific data citeable as publications. In this system, a data set would be attributed to its investigators as authors like it would be done for a work in the conventional scientific literature. 
Thus, scientific primary data should not exclusively understood as part of a scientific publication, but may have its own identity.
