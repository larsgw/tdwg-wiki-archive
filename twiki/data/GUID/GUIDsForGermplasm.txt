---++ GUIDs for Germplasm

I have collected here some links as an entry to this GUID wiki for the Germplasm community. I hope to start a discussion on how to implemet the LSID technology in the germplasm community and in particular for the _genebanks_ (seedbanks) holding samples of plant genetic resources.

Germplasm is used here to describe conserved samples of the economically valuable crops and the crop wild relatives. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germplasm][Wikipedia describe germplasm]] as "the genetic resources, or more precisely the DNA of an organism and collections of that material".
