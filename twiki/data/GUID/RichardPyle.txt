---+++ Specific area(s) of interest within biodiversity informatics
   * Database and web development for all types of biodiversity informatics (taxonomy, specimen, geopsatial, bibliographic, descriptive data, imaging [still & video], etc.);
   * Standards development;
   * Distributed database development
   * In particular, I am involved with the development of "ZooBank", the proposed ICZN registry of zoological names; a system that will absolutely require the implementation of GUIDs.

---+++ Would you be able to devote time to web-based discussions as part of a working group between the two workshops?
