---++ GUID Requirements Specific to Specimens and Collections

*Requirements:*

   * Metadata must identify different categories of specimens and preparations (e.g. survey, trap, individual, leg preparation, tissue)
   * Metadata must identify duplicates of specimens in different collections (like in Herbaria, for example)
   * Metadata must identify original specimen record when served by aggregators
   * Metadata must link identifier to original specimen record when aggregator adds value to it (e.g. adding a geo-reference)

*Issues:*

   * Can a service like DiGIR or BioCase provide GUIDs when underlying collection doesn't provide one?
   * Must collections management software store versions of database records, and assign versioned GUIDs to them? Can DiGIR, BioCase or Tapir software implement that feature instead?
