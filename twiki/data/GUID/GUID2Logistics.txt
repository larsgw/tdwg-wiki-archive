---+++ Logistics for GUID-2 
----
---++++ Registration

Registration is open to invitees at http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/682/. If you have been invited, please register NOW.

If you are also attending the RDF meeting you should specify in the registration for *both* meetings that you want to stay in the Novotel.

----
---++++ Accommodation

Please be certain to use the registration to fill in the hotel nights required and the budget (between 70-85 pounds it would seem). The hotel will be determined by the eSI staff. They are trying to get everyone into the same hotel, but as it is a busy time around the meeting dates, this may not be possible. It seems that most are booked into the Radisson in High Street (about a 1.3km walk from eSI)

*You WILL get a conformation e-mail from the eScience Centre containing dteails of your hotel booking. Please check the details and be sure to contact for conformation at least 2 full days before arrival.*

If you are also attending the RDF meeting you should specify in the registration for *both* meetings that you want to stay in same hotel.

---+++ Reimbursement Procedure

I've written a brief description of how to use the [[GBIFreimbursementspreadsheet][GBIF reimbursement spreadsheet]]. Details of the guidelines and the spreadsheet can be found at http://www.gbif.org/Support/travel. 

*Please remember that we would like you to do the reimbursement as soon as possible after GUID-2 so that we can clear the budget before June 30.*
