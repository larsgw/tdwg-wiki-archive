@---++ Use Case: Identifying Taxonomy For Identifications 

----
---+++++ Description
Any data resource which holds information related to biological taxa should be able to identify not just the scientific name of the taxon concerned but also the taxon concept intended by the identifier.  This applies for example to catalogues of biological collections, and to databases of biological images, sequences, etc. 

If data records are related simply to a scientific name, it may not be possible to make an unambiguous decision on the relevance of the data in cases in which there are different concepts associated with the name.  

If data records are related to a scientific name used in the sense of an identified publication (revision, checklist, etc.) it may become possible to automate some such decisions.  

---+++++ Notes
   1.  Note that such automation does not require that all possible taxonomic mappings have been modeled.  It may be possible to focus simply on relationships between particularly important checklists.  As an example, an ecologist may have data sets describing the vegetation of a single area from the present day and from the early part of the 20th century.  Each of these data sets may have been compiled using the standard regional flora of the day.  In such a case, the only important mapping is between the two floras concerned (and this same mapping may also be useful for mapping between many other data sets from the two periods concerned).
   1.  Implementations could be based on unique identifiers applied to every concept or simply to every name and every relevant publication (a name-publication pair then uniquely identifying each concept).  In the same way a data set could make a global assertion that all concepts used for its identifications derive from a given publication (and then simply give the scientific names for each identification), or alternatively could explicit indicate a taxon concept for every identification.
