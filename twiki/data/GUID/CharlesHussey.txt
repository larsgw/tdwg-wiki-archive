[[www.nhm.ac.uk][The Natural History Museum]]


*Biodiversity informatics:*
I have been attending TDWG meetings on and off since 1995 and am a member of the CODATA/TDWG Task Group on Access to Biological Collections Data - one of the participants in the original workshop in Santa Barbara.

*Reasons for interest in participation in GUID standards development*
I have been tasked with monitoring the development of GUIDs for specimens and taxonomic names (and taxonomic concepts :-)) and to advise on preparations for their adoption within the NHM. The National Biodiversity Network [[www.nbn.org.uk][www.nbn.org.uk]] also need to plan for their adoption.
