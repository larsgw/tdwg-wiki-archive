@---++ Publication Bank

*Coordinator(s):* Robert Huber

*Participants:*

----
---+++ Description
This group will investigate the feasibility, existing actors and requirements for a ''Publication Bank'', i.e., a resource to act as a central registry of taxonomic literature and its digital representations, including assigning GUIDs to each publication.

----
---+++ Discussion
DonaldHobern 17 March 2006: It is also important to make sure we understand what is happening with the Biodiversity Heritage Library Project (http://www.bhl.si.edu/).  If you look at their prospectus, they state that their planned components include:

   2. Combine our existing bibliographic holdings for biodiversity publications in a combined "union catalog" database, perhaps done in collaboration with an existing bibliographic utility such as OCLC or RLG or with a non-profit third party such as the Internet Archive.
   3. Create a website to host the union catalog and to manage and provide access to the digitized content.

Collaborating with this initiative may be the best way to get a unified bibliographic catalogue (especially for the earlier literature).

RobertHuber 12 April 2006: Following the discussion on PublicationBank and after the results of the survey, I must confess I still have some difficulties to see what exactly PublicationBank will be and how it could be implemented. 
Therefore I would just like to throw the survey results and some of my thoughts/ideas here and on the WIKI. I hope this will stimulate the discussion..

---+++++ Current status of bibliographic data (Survey Result)
Based on the survey I sent around, it can be said that there are many ways how bib data is treated by participating dbs.  I received 7 
responses to the survey. 
For about 50%, bib modules are not or incomplete normalized, but the majority stores the complete set of bibliographic information I asked
for (or even more). However, some institutions use abbreviations(e.g. Brummit) only as bibliographic information.
About 50% store authors names as strings and 50% store last name, first name separately. Journal and other sources are stored mostly as both, abbreviation and full journal name.
The results give a good impression of the difficulties a operating PublicationBank might expect. In some way PublicationBank will serve 
GUIDs and to do this it will need to know e.g. Author, Year and source/ journal to find the appropriate GUID. 
So the question is can this information easily be extracted from the existing dbs to formulate a query by participating institutions? 
The other reason why I cretaed the survey was to find out whether the existing dbs can be used as initial sources contributing their entries to PublicationBank to have an initial set of citations.
The good point is that most institutions store the complete set of bib info, however it might be a bit difficult to e.g. extract the volume or issue information when the db is not normalized and the info is stored as a string. Same difficulties may occur for author 
names, this depends on how the string is stored (Last Name, Initial, Last Name, Initial would be difficult..). 
Important is that both, abbreviations as well as complete citations are stored in the dbs.
In summary it can be said that it will probably not be easy to create a initial citation pool for PublicationBank because the current status of bib data is too heterogenous. It will also be difficult for some of the dbs to extract the necessary info from their dbs to be able to effectively use PublicationBank. But as I said this depends on the detailled way their data is stored. Some might need to put some additional efforts on their dbs, but most surely could rightaway start to query PublicationBank.

---+++++ What should PublicationBank be:
   1.  A service provider for existing taxonomic databases to ease the management of bibliographic data. It allows client databases to check   their existing bib entries against PublicationBank and to retrieve a GUID.
   2.  An external, common bibliographic management system for existing taxonomic databases. It allows client databases to concentrate on taxonomic information, thus to leave all bib related data management at PublicationBank. Client dbs would  internally use only GUIDs, no bibliographic module needed anymore.
   3.  to be _the_ bibliographic ressource for biodiversity relevant publications 1) and 2) included but major(curatorial/librarian)additional efforts are made to analyze, find and store relevant publications.

---+++++ What is "relevant" bibliographic data
   1.  Gets relevant on demand -The literature/citations which is already stored (and will be stored in the future) in taxonomic database using PublicationBank see above scenarios 19 and 2)
   2.  Is "per se" relevant - Any literature which treats biodiversity/taxonomy etc. relevant topics

---+++++ What gets an GUID?
   1.  Abbreviations (such as Brummit & Powell)
   2.  Copmplete citations
   3.  Both

---+++++ Granularity of biblographic data (Roger Hyam):
   1. LSID for the Journal/Book 
   2. LSID for the volume 
   3. LSID for the part 
   4. LSID for the article 
   5. LSID for the actual description on page 15. 
I assume all except 5 are usually treated by bibliographic databases?

---+++++ Where to get GUIDs from?
   1.  CrossRef / Journals (DOIs)
   2.  Citation Databases (PubMed.. ISI, Georef)
   3.  Library digitization efforts (Animal base (http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de), Google books, )
   4.  Assign our own PublicationBank LSID (e.g. as preliminary GUIDs)
...

---+++++ Which ressources are already there?
   1.  CrossRef and other bibliographic GUID resolver services
   2.  IPNI and uBIOS 'author abbreviation resolver'
...know more?
some ressources could help but do not use GUIDs ( AnimalBase etc), 
we need to encourage these initiatives to use GUIDs   

---+++++ Are there initiatives/products which could help or take over the whole thing?
   1.  Biodiversity Heritage Library Project (http://www.bhl.si.edu/)
   2.  Natures Connotea project (http://www.connotea.org/)

---+++++ Which other people need to be involved?
   1.  Librarians

---+++++ What will be the components of PublicationBank and how will they interact
   1.  ([[BibliographicQueryResolver][Bibliographic Query Resolver]]):
   Literature which already is stored and used by LSID authorities probably should be the starting point for PublicationBank. Therefore it will need to access bibliographic lookup services  offered by the publishers, other citation databases such as PubMED or GUID managing organisations like CrossRef to retrieve the GUIDs and correct citations to initially populate the database.
