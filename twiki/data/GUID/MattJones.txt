---+++ Institutional affiliation
   * Database and Information Specialist
   * National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis
   * University of California, Santa Barbara

---+++ Specific area(s) of interest within biodiversity informatics
   * All areas of data management and analytical processing of environmental data
   * standards development and data system interoperability
   * distributed data systems, e.g. EcoGrid
   * metadata languages, e.g., Ecological Metadata Language and the NBII Biological Data Profile
   * collaboration through scientific workflow systems (e.g., [[Kepler]])

---+++  Reasons for interest in participation in GUID standards development
   Many projects that I participate have a distinct need for standardized identifiers for digital artifacts.  These include data (e.g., EcoGrid), metadata (e.g., EML) and analytical systems (e.g., [[Kepler]]).  I am a part of the [[http://seek.ecoinformatics.org][SEEK project]] where we have been diligently working towards software solutions in ecological and biodiversity sciences that promote integrated and seamless access to digital resources by practicing scientists.  Some of our work has contributed to other TDWG standards such as the [[TCS][Taxonomic Concept Schema]].

---+++  Would you be able to devote time to web-based discussions as part of a working group between the two workshops?
   Yes, and I could also help to organize workshops where needed.
