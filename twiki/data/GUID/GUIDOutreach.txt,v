@---++ GUID Outreach

*Coordinator(s):*

Lee Belbin

*Participants:*

Richard Pyle, Ben Szekely, Rod Page

----
---+++ Description
To coordinate the development of documentation for outreach to the broader community to encourage uptake and support of GUIDs and LSIDs.

----
---+++ Discussion

The group discussed the need to address a range of 'target audiences' in the community with specific documents.

----
---+++ Conclusions and Recommendations

Documentation needs to be targeted to three classes of clients)-

   * Managers, CEOs, CIOs
      1.  Lee to write one web page on justification for GUIDs and LSIDs
      1.  Answer what's in it for my institution or group
      1.  Look to DOIs (but maybe not mention)
      1.  Possibly provide an example link

   * Biologists, Taxonomists, Bioinformaticists
      1.  Rich to write 1-2 pages largely around an example demonstrating key benefits
      1.  Rod to tidy example and assist Rich

   * IT/Developer Community
      1.  Ben to gather developer resources (done) to Ricardo
      1.  Gap analysis on software resources required (Ricardo)
      1.  Gap analysis on additional and filler documentation required (Roger)
      1.  Ricardo will e-mail Ben about plugin requirements and Ben will address these issues and report back to Ricardo
      1.  Link to RDF benefits and software requirements groups

As a second priority, we will consider targeting a specific domain
   * Is there a SIGNIFICANT community we could sell LSID benefits to?
      1.  Fish
      1.  Ants
