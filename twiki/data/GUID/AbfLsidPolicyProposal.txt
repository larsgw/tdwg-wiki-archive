---++ A policy for LSID implementation, and a roadmap for the integration of this technology, within the Australasian Biodiversity Federation.

Uniquely identified data objects are fundamental to the successful implementation of our biodiversity information networks.

Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) are seen as the key to delivering on many of the basic requirements expected of distributed biodiversty information systems. Custodianship; discovery of duplication; effective validation procedures; data update, indexing and caching services; verification of derived product; tracking of annotations etc, ... Much depends on our ability to return to individual records.

   * GUIDs are are permanently associated with their data objects. 
   * A GUID system can locate data objects and provide access to object metadata.

TDWG is recommending LSID as a standard GUID technology for biodiversity informatics objects and aims to formalize usage within our community. To this end the TDWG GUID subgroup has produced an LSID applicability statement and a roadmap for LSID implementation.

The TDWG Infrastructure Project (TIP) is now supporting a workshop in Canberra to establish policy guidelines for the application of LSIDs within the Australasian biodiversity federation and to develop to a roadmap for LSID implementation by, or for, local data providers and biodiversity informatics networks.

These outcomes and the process by which we achieve them are expected to provide valuable feedback to the TDWG GUID Group and to inform future LSID implementation projects. 

Building on the TDWG LSID Applicability Statement and LSID Roadmap the aims are:

   * To establish key principles for LSID integration; 
   * To prioritize LSID assignment; 
   * To make recommendations as to the delegation of responsibility for  allocation,  persistence and resolution of GUIDs and; 
   * To document a workplan and timeline for the implementation of GUID technology.
