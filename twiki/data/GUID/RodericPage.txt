---+++ Institutional affiliation
University of Glasgow

---+++ Specific area(s) of interest within biodiversity informatics

   * Phylogenetic databases
   * taxonomic name servers
   * GUIDs
   * federated databases
   * semantic web

---+++ Reasons for interest in participation in GUID standards development

I've implemented LSIDs for 

   * taxonomic names in the [[http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/portal/][Taxonomic Search Engine]] )
   * specimen images [[http://sid.zoology.gla.ac.uk][SID]]

My primary interest is developing a phylogenetic database with links to external data sources such as literature, specimens, sequences, and images. I'm also part of the [[http://biocorder.org][BioCorder]] project.

---+++ Would you be able to devote time to web-based discussions as part of a working group between the two workshops?
   Yes
