---+!! Welcome to the Globally Unique Identifiers (GUID) Wiki

Welcome to the *TDWG GUID Wiki*. This is a collaboration area used to discuss the use of *Globally Unique Identifiers* (*GUIDs*) in our community. The [[http://wiki.gbif.org/guidwiki/wikka.php?wakka=HomePage][first Wiki discussion]] about GUIDs in the lead up to the two TIP sponsored GUID meetings (see below) was hosted on the GBIF site.

---++ A Definition of Globally Unique Identifiers (for the purposes of this group)

A *globally unique identifier*, or *GUID*, is a system that provides mechanisms to identify and access *data objects* on the Web. The main characteristics of a GUID system are:
   * GUID systems have *identifiers*, which are character strings associated with data objects. *urn:lsid:tdwg.org:TaxonName:12345* and *doi:10.1000/182* are examples of identifiers.
   * An identifier in a GUID system is *persistent*, i.e., it is *permanently* associated with a data object. 
   * An identifier in a GUID system is *globally unique*, i.e., it identifies a single data object uniquely within the system.
   * Identifiers in a GUID system are *actionable*, i.e., the system provides mechanisms for clients to access a data object from its associated identifier. This is equivalent to saying that objects in a GUID system are *locatable*.
   * A GUID system also provides mechanisms to describe data objects, i.e., it provides *metadata* about them.

---++ GUID Working Groups

Two main working groups have been created during [[GUID1Workshop][GUID-1 Workshop]] (see the [[GUID1Report][report]]) to implement the initial components of the GUID infrastructure and to address outstanding issues:

   * InfrastructureWorkingGroup - will address the key issues regarding the deployment of LSID as the GUID technology for biodiversity informatics.
   * PrototypingWorkingGroup - will develop prototypes of test cases to test aspects of a GUID infrastructure.
