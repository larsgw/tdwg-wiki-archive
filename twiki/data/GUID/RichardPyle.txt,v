---+++ Specific area(s) of interest within biodiversity informatics
   * Database and web development for all types of biodiversity informatics (taxonomy, specimen, geopsatial, bibliographic, descriptive data, imaging [still & video], etc.);
   * Standards development;
   * Distributed database development
   * In particular, I am involved with the development of "ZooBank", the proposed ICZN registry of zoological names; a system that will absolutely require the implementation of GUIDs.

---+++ Reasons for interest in participation in GUID standards development

As both an active taxonomist, and database and web developer, I have a particular interest in helping to develop data standards to allow more seamless exchange of and access to biodiversity data. My work is connected with the Pacific Basin Information Node of the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII).  I long ago recognized the value of GUIDs for biodiversity data, and have spent a significant amount of time trying to persuade my colleagues of the importance of universally adopted 

---+++ Would you be able to devote time to web-based discussions as part of a working group between the two workshops?

Yes, absolutely!!
