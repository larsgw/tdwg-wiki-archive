---+++ LSID Extension for Firefox

The [[http://lsid.mozdev.org/][LSID extension for FireFox]] enables  resolution of lsidres URIs. The lsidres protocol is used by IBM's [[http://lsid.sourceforge.net/][LaunchPad]] for Life Sciencer Identifiers (LSIDs). At present, LauchPad is only available for Internet Explorer 6 running on Windows. This extension enables FireFox users to resolve LSIDs directly within their web browser. For example, after the extension is installed, clicking on the LSID 
  lsidres:urn:lsid:limnology.wisc.edu:dataset:ntlch01 will display metadata for a record provided by the [[http://lsid.limnology.wisc.edu/][North Temperate Lakes LTER]].

As a link, if you were writing an HTML file, then
%%(html4strict) <a href="lsidres:urn:lsid:limnology.wisc.edu:dataset:ntlch01">
urn:lsid:limnology.wisc.edu:dataset:ntlch01
</a>%%:
would generate a clickable link that the LSID extension will resolve (of course, you can also just paste the LSID into the browser) 

For a taxonomic name example, try the NCBI record for _Aphanocladium album_
 lsidres:urn:lsid:ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.lsid.zoology.gla.ac.uk:TaxId:12942
 
The extension relies on a resolver running at Glasgow, and this is occassionally a little flaky. You may need to sometimes reload the browser view to view the  metadata.
