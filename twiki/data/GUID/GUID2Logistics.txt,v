@---+++ Logistics for GUID-2 
----
---++++ Registration

Registration is open to invitees at http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/682/. If you have been invited, please register NOW.

If you are also attending the RDF meeting you should specify in the registration for *both* meetings that you want to stay in the Novotel.

----
---++++ Accommodation

Please be certain to use the registration to fill in the hotel nights required and the budget (between 70-85 pounds it would seem). The hotel will be determined by the eSI staff. They are trying to get everyone into the same hotel, but as it is a busy time around the meeting dates, this may not be possible. It seems that most are booked into the Radisson in High Street (about a 1.3km walk from eSI)

*You WILL get a conformation e-mail from the eScience Centre containing dteails of your hotel booking. Please check the details and be sure to contact for conformation at least 2 full days before arrival.*

If you are also attending the RDF meeting you should specify in the registration for *both* meetings that you want to stay in same hotel.

---+++ About the Venue: eSI

   * General eSI information - http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/intro.html 
   * How to get there (includes a link to a walk map) - http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/esi_travel.html
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/Radisson_eSI.gif][Walk map from the Radisson Hotel to e-Science Institute]]

----
---+++ Reimbursement Procedure

I've written a brief description of how to use the [[GBIFreimbursementspreadsheet][GBIF reimbursement spreadsheet]]. Details of the guidelines and the spreadsheet can be found at http://www.gbif.org/Support/travel. 

*Please remember that we would like you to do the reimbursement as soon as possible after GUID-2 so that we can clear the budget before June 30.*

Accommodation will be at the Novotel http://www.novotel.com/novotel/fichehotel/gb/nov/3271/fiche_hotel.shtml.
It is a new hotel with good facilites and is close to the eScience centre. This will be organised through eSI's registration process so you *don't* need to contact the hotel.
