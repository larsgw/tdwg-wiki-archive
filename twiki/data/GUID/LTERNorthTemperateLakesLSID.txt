---++ North Temperate Lakes LTER LSID Authority

From [[http://lsid.limnology.wisc.edu/][North Temperate Lakes LDID Authority Website]]:

"The first public LSID resolution server. This LSID authority is made possible through a strategic partnership between the North Temperate Lakes LTER and Algenta Technologies.

"This server creates a semantic web of data and metadata information drawn from the NTL-LTER datasets, delivered in an RDF format. Each piece of data or metadata is referenced by a globally unique LSID URN. These identifiers are then be referenced by the metadata of other LSIDs, creating relationships between diverse datasets regardless of content management schemas. This allows for a simple integration path among various researchers and institutions to attain wide-area interoperability with multiple, distributed data systems while maintaining their current infrastructure. The LSIDs are resolved through a web-service interface running on this machine. "
