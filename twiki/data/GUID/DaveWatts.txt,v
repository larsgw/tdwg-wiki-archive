*Affiliation:*

Australian Antarctic Division - use above address


*Biodiversity informatics:*

I am responsible for building a database of terrestrial and limentic data from all areas of the Antarctic for a major Scientific Committee of Antarctic Science (SCAR) sponsored project. We also cater for marine data within the Australian area which is bounded by Australia to the north, Heard Island to the west and Macquarie Island to the east. As with any large database we need optimal ways to manage content, avoid duplicate data and ensure ready access to it for a large range of users. This then covers the whole range of good database design, intuitive user interfaces and linkages to other intenal and external data sources, either via database calls, URL links or web services. 

As part of the Antarctic community, we are encouraged to make all data freely available. We have few jurisdictional boundaries or politics to deal with. It is for these reasons we have been an active data provider within GBIF/OBIS since November 2003. Our group has had extensive experience with metadata as we manage one of the largest metadata databases outside the GCMD at NASA. Within a few months we will have an ISO compliant system supplied by GCMD at our site and then we will be able to add metdata harvesting services for external sites.

A key problem that I would like solved is validation of many taxa names, many unique to the Antarctic. Attaching GUID's would ensure that process can occur in a robust fashion.

*Reasons for participation*:

Over the last few years we have started to experience the problem of persistence of data and objects wihin our database. We are getting more requests from the staff of the Australian Antarctic Division to quote an immutable URL for data or database web pages for references within publications.Even if a URL is persistant, there is little to control changing the contents. At present, I use unique internal identifiers in my database to help cross-link data but these are not public and cannot be used in any global sense. I believe that this problem needs to be solved soon since database content is growing rapidly. It would also help in tracing the source of data as it gets transformed. I spend a considerable amount of time massaging data into suitable formats for database loading or other uses. A persistent identifer that followed the same path, which also includes web services,  would help solve the emerging audit problem of where did that data come from.

*Time for web-based discussions:*

Apart from a major local conference in Hobart in July 2006, most of my work activities can be adjusted to suit this project, as it has important ramifications far beyond bioinformatics.
