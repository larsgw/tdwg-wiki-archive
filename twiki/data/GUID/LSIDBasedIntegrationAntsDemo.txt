---++ LSID Based Integration Ants Demonstration

---+++ Description
The original description was: "This group will develop a prototype system that integrates LSID based data. It will use ants as specific taxon group."

This is sort of what I've done. What I'm aiming for is something like the diagram below, where diverse sources of data are integrated into a triple store. The two key issues of relevance to TDWG GUID are the use of GUIDs to identify digital objects, and the use of metadata as RDF.

For details on how this was done, please see [[http://semant.blogspot.com/][my blog]] (I find it a lot easier to blog stuff as it gets done, rather than edit a Wiki).

---+++ Discussion, Implementation Issues

For background please see http://semant.blogspot.com/.

The server has two IP's, and this causes Google Maps some confusion -- if you get a warning about the Google Maps API key, just ignore it.
