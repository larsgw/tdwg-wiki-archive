---+++ The Infrastructure Working Group

This group was formed to address the key issues regarding the deployment of LSID as the GUID technology for biodiversity informatics. The mandate of this working group is to identify required or desirable policies and infrastructure components to ensure robust, long-term operation of shared GUIDs.

The following activities were identified:

   1. LSIDMinimalStandards - Specify minimal standards (including tools and services) for GUID issuance.
   2. LSIDLongTermArchival - Investigate long-term archival of LSIDs and associated data and metadata.
   3. GUIDCentralRegistrationAuthority - Investigate establishing (optional) central registration authority.
   4. GUIDOrphanDatasets - Investigate establishing repository for data and (orphan) datasets with GUIDs.
   5. PublicationBank - Investigate the feasibility, existing actors and requirements for a "Publication Bank".
   6. ConceptualVsDigitalLSIDs - Clarify the distinction between GUIDs assigned to data objects and to conceptual entities.
   7. GUIDAnnotationAndLinkOut - Investigate 3rd-party annotation and link-out mechanisms.
   8. [[GUIDOutreach]] - Develop materials to communicate with wider community.
   9. LSIDResolverNamespaces - Develop best practices for assigning resolver namespaces for LSIDs.
   10. LSIDSpecificationReview - Perform review of LSID specification to identify possible enhancements.
   11. LSIDSoftwareGapAnalysis - Perform gap analysis of LSID software.


The outcomes of this group will be a series of white papers addressing the key infrastructure issues. Those will be reviewed during the second GUID meeting later this year.
