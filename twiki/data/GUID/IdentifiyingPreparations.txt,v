@---++ Use Case: Identifiying Different Specimen Preparations 

----
---+++++ Description
Different communities within biological collections have different sets of biological _objects_ they want to assign identifiers to. For example, an entomological collection may have the following series of _specimens_:

survey->contents of a trap->individual insect->insect part->DNA preparation

Other communities have a different set of identifiable objects. 

Some users may be interested in a particular preparation (e.g. give me all records of mammal tissues from which a destructive sample can be extracted), while others may not (e.g., give me all occurrences of _Acacia polyphylla_ from Brazil).

There is an interesting project from the geo community which tries to build a central sample registry (SESAR): http://www.geosamples.org/<br />
Also the IODP (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program) is thinking about introducing Ids (real GUIDs here) for samples (core-&gt;core section-&gt;samples)<br />
<br />
This sounds very similar to the approach above, at least until DNA preparation. Maybe we should distinguish between sample and sample preparation?<br />
<br />
Maybe it would be a good idea to initiate something like a 'common sample guid project' and build up a interdisciplinary globally unique sample identification scheme?
