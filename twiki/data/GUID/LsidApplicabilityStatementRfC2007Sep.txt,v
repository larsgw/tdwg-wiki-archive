---++ TDWG !LSID Applicability Statement - Request for Comments (Sept/2007 - current)

The [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/tip/][TDWG Infrastructure Project (TIP)]] has been working on a *new* draft of the *TDWG !LSID Applicability Statement*. This document-
   1. provides guidance on how to use Life Sciences Identifiers (LSID) to meet specific requirements of the biodiversity information community and
   1. defines how to identify shared data objects in biodiversity information applications using LSID.

This specification, soon to be submitted to TDWG for ratification, summarizes all agreed decisions by the [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/guid/][TDWG-GUID group]] and addresses the requirements of the [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/tag/][TAG group]].

We would like to ask you to please *review* the applicability statement and provide feedback. The document is available at:

http://www.tdwg.org/standards/150/download/ (it is also available in [[%ATTACHURL%/TDWG_LSID_Applicability_Statement_2007_08_30.pdf][PDF format]])

This version of the applicability statement is significantly different from [[LsidApplicabilityStatementRfC2006Oct][the version reviewed last year]]. For that reason, we would like to ask those who kindly reviewed the previous version of the document to review this one as well. 

Please make your comments using one (or more) of the following methods: 

   1. Send your comments to tdwg-guid@@lists.tdwg.org or directly to ricardo@@tdwg.org;
   1. Revise the MS Word document posted above using the _Track Changes_ feature and send it to ricardo@@tdwg.org.
   1. Post your comments at the end of this wiki page using the template.

All comments will be later collated at the end of this page.

When we are all satisfied with the contents of this applicability statement, we intend to ratify it as a TDWG standard.

We would really appreciate your feedback.
