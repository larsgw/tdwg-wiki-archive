---++ Use Case: Resolving Taxon Concepts 

----
---+++++ Description
As the amount of available digital biodiversity data increases, there is a growing need for tools which can identify data and information relevant to a user request, even if the taxonomy used for the user request does not match that used in the online data.  Such tools will only be possible if it becomes easier for data resources to identify the publications and concepts used to identify organisms.
