The UMASS-Boston Roaming Metadata Enriched Images (RMEI) project is building infrastructure and applications to support the collaborative annotation of digital images, audio and video supporting remote provision of content metadata for JPEG2000 media which "roam" around the internet as semi-autonomous agents that can communicate with the original service-published media and with other copies of it. The project has identified several needs for GUIDs of both JPEG2000 media and the individual pieces of the rich information within them. Of special interest to us is how the evolution of such agents can be tracked reliably, and recovering GUID assignment history is one problem we see.

Details of the plans of this project are in the narrative of the NSF grant that supports it, which can be found at http://efg.cs.umb.edu/GRANTS/RMEI.pdf. Prototype development is underway and we should be exposing more of this late in 2005.
