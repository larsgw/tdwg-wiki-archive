---+++ Discussion, Implementation Issues

In the Kepler scientific workflow system (http://kepler-project.org), scientific analyses and models can be represented as workflows that model the flow of data from one processing step to another.  Processing steps, called 'actors' in Kepler, can be as fine grained (e.g., simple addition) or coarse-grained (e.g., the GARP model) as desired by the scientist.  Kepler models are published in the Modeling Markup Language (MoML) and are executable using the Kepler Scientific Workflow system.  Within Kepler, each analytical component that is published or that ships with Kepler is assigned its own LSID.  The component is serialized in a Kepler archive (.kar) file that contains a manifest listing its LSID and other metadata.  The .kar file can be shipped between Kepler systems (e.g., via email or web, etc) and opened by other Kepler users, allowing people to share their analytical work.  Combined with strongly-versioned data sets that are also referenced by LSIDs in the models (See LSIDResolverForObservations), the KAR file can represent a complete scientific model and all of the data need to execute that model.

Analytical models in Kepler that might be of more general use can be saved from Kepler and published to the Kepler actor library (http://library.kepler-project.org), which makes them available for download and use by other Kepler users.  Most of this system is currently functional in prototype form.

Future features include the ability to search the Kepler actor library from directly within the Kepler user interface and directly import and use analytical components found through this search.  This is analogous to the current EcoGrid data search that is available in Kepler for locating ecological data, observational data, specimen data, and geophysical data through the EcoGrid web service interfaces.
