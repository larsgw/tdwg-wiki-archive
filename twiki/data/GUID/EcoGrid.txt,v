@---++ SEEK EcoGrid 

The [[http://seek.ecoinformatics.org/Wiki.jsp?page=EcoGrid][SEEK EcoGrid]] is a Grid service-based architecture for accessing heterogeneous data resources in the ecological, biodiversity, and geological sciences.  The service API defined by the EcoGrid allows many different data systems to interoperate through simple service calls.  This standardization allows scientific applications such as the [[Kepler]] scientific workflow system to access diverse data systems using a uniform set of programatic service calls.  Thus, Kepler can access ecological monitoring data from the [[http://knb.ecoinformatics.org][KNB]] with the same calls that it accesses biodiversity collections data through the GBIF DiGIR portal and the GEON Data Portal.

Data and metadata returned by EcoGrid are currently identified using identifiers from the native system from which the object originated.  However, the EcoGrid design team has agreed in principle to standardize on [[LSID]] identifiers to promote ineroperability among the diverse data systems that make up the EcoGrid.  Other standards that were considered were DOIs, the Handle system, and some proprietary systems.
