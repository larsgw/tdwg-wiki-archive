---++ GUID-2 Workshop

The e-Science Institute [[http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/]] is going to host the *Second International Workshop on Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) for Biodiversity Infromatics (GUID-2)*, June 10-12, 2006 in Edinburgh Scotland. 

GUID-2 is being organised by the Taxonomic Databases Working Group's (TDWG - http://www.tdwg.org) Infrastructure Project. This workshop will review the activity of the [[CategoryWorkingGroup][Working Groups]] established at the [[GUID1Workshop][First GUID Workshop]] hosted by NESCent in Durham, North Carolina (February 1-3, 2006) and generate final recommendations for establishing an effective infrastructure to support the use of LSIDs in biological informatics.

---+++ Goals

   * Review the activities of the Working Groups formed at GUID-1
   * Final recommendations for establishing an effective infrastructure to support widespread use of LSIDs in biodiversity informatics

----
---+++ Involvement

''*Invitations to GUID-2 are now closed.*''

We still encourage *anyone* who is interested in helping to establish a global infrastructure to support the widespread use of LSIDs to get involved (quickly!) with either of the two [[CategoryWorkingGroup][Working Groups]]-

   * [[InfrastructureWorkingGroup][GUID-1 Infrastructure Working Group]]
   * [[PrototypingWorkingGroup][GUID-1 Prototyping Working Group]]

There are very limited places for GUID-2. Invitations to attend the workshop were based on contributions within the two working groups and representate client agencies. Airfares and expenses will be paid to attend GUID-2 from funding supplied by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (http://www.moore.org/).
