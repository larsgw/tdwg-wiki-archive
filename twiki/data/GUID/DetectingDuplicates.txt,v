---++ Use Case: Detecting Duplicates 

----
---+++++ Description
There are many situations in which data relating to a single specimen may be made available through multiple online data services.  A typical scenario would be that a zoological museum may database a collection of organisms and make it available through its own web site, while at the same time making the data available to a regional or thematic portal.  The portal may make these data available as part of a larger aggregation of data.  It can then be very difficult to be certain whether records refer to the same specimen and records may be counted incorrectly for many kinds of analysis.
