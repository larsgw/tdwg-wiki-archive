---++ LSID Resolver for Taxon Names (IF)

*Coordinator(s):* Paul Kirk, Kevin Richards.

*Participants:* Paul Kirk, Kevin Richards, Roger Hyam.

See the other taxon name LSID resolver prototype: LSIDResolverForTaxonNamesIPNI

----
---+++ Description
This group will develop a prototype LSID resolver for taxon names. The prototype will be developed by nomenclators using Index Fungorum (IF) database and an RDF version of TCS-Names. 

----
---+++ Technical Information

   * *URL for prototype user interface:* 
   * *LSID authority(ies):* indexfungorum.org
   * *LSID namespace(s):* at present just 1 namespace - 'names'
   * *Hardware platform:* Dell !PowerEdge 2300, twin PII 350MHz, 256MB RAM (upgrade to 512MB pending), HDDs: OS mirror (2x4.5GB), DATA raid 5 (3x9GB), HDDs are 10k U160, 64MB controller cache. It's about 7 years old and worth about 40 Euro
   * *Server platform:* Windows 2003 Server, IIS
   * *LSID Software stack used:* LSID .NET (originally Java LSID stack 1.1.2)
   * *RDF/OWL ontology used for metadata:* TCS-RDF
   * *Approximate number of LSIDs stored:* 385943
   * *Other resources:*
   * *Sample LSIDs:*
   * lsidres:urn:lsid:indexfungorum.org:Names:213649

----
---+++ Roadmap, Milestones, Timeline

   * Feb/06 - Set up webserver  (COMPLETE 9 March 2006)
   * Feb/06 - Install Java LSID server stack, with service returning basic xml of IndexFungorum fields
             (COMPLETE 9 March 2006)
   * Mar-Apr/06 - Complete LSID framework porting to Microsoft.NET platform (COMPLETE June 2006)
   * May/06 - Install .NET LSID authority/service framework (COMPLETE Spetember 2006)
   * May/06 - Return RDF with TCS xml schema components, from LSID authority (COMPLETE May 2006)

---+++ Discussion, Implementation Issues

(List issues, readblocks, missing software components, etc)


----
---+++ Lessons Learned, Conclusions, Recommendations

   * use code platform for which you are most comfortable/familiar (saves time).  Make the resolver as simple as will do the job.
   * knowledge/understanding of RDF technologies is necessary.  The evaluation and understanding of RDF schemas and how to map fields and data into these schemas can be quite open to different interpretations.  This may be the biggest hurdle later when trying to summarise data and preform any sort of inference.
