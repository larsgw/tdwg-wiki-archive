I am [[http://www.norge.no/][Norwegian]] and walked my childhood days in [[http://www.arendal.com/][Arendal]] located in the south of Norway. I received my university training at [[http://www.ntnu.no/indexe.php][The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)]], [[http://www.biotech.ntnu.no/molgen/][Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Group]] in Trondheim, Norway. The diploma thesis for my masters degree was on gene expression in prokaryotes (Bacteria). I live in MalmÃ¶, Sweden since 1999.

---+++++ Data interoperability consultant, IPGRI 

I am for the time beeing, working as IT consultant on data interoperability at IPGRI headquarters in Rome. My main responsibilities for the GenerationCP is the development of the Central Repository and Registry together with Tom Hazekamp and Milko Skofic. See [[http://gcpcr.grinfo.net][http://gcpcr.grinfo.net]].

---+++++ Database developer, Nordic Gene Bank, NGB, Sweden 

I have been working at the Nordic Gene Bank, NGB, since 1999 as database developer. Since 2002 I was the head of IT and documentation. Presently I am on leave from my position at NGB, working as secondment for IPGRI in Rome. My main responsibilities at NGB involve the development of the institute Germplasm information system, [[http://tor.ngb.se/sesto/index.php?scp=ngb][SESTO]] and the strategic planning of the IT activities. The NGB germplasm information system, [[http://tor.ngb.se/sesto/][SESTO]], is a regional genebank documentation system in use by many more institutes than only the NGB in Sweden. Genebanks in the neighbouring Nordic and Baltic countries also use the system from their remote locations to manage the data on their local germplasm collections. Presently all the data is stored in the NGB database at location in Sweden, but we are experimenting together with the Vavilov institute in Russia to implement a version of SESTO at location in St Petersburg for the Russian germplasm collection.
