---++ Use Case: Identifiying Datasets Used in Analyses or Publications 

----
---+++++ Description
Primary biodiversity data are used in a variety of applications, such as taxonomic research, floras and faunas, biogeographic studies, species diversity and populations, impact of climate change, ecology, evolution and genetics (Chapman, 2005). Although in most cases both the study and the source data can be made available online, the live connection between them is lost upon publication. 

The connection between the publication and its source data can be preserved using GUIDs.

In some cases, the source dataset is composed of hundreds or thousands of individual data records, each identified by a GUID. In those cases, additional resolution mechanisms may be necessary to resolve and retrieve the source data efficiently. Examples of initiatives towards this goal are: the [[STDDOI]] and the [[http://seek.ecoinformatics.org][SEEK]] projects.
