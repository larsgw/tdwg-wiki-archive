---++++ The "GUIDs for Data Objects vs. Conceptual Entities" Working Group

GUIDs may be assigned to both "digital objects" (specific byte sequences), or to conceptual ("abstract") entities, and this group concluded that both play a role in biodiversity informatics.

__Digital Byte Sequences__
   * Permanent, unchanging sequences of digital bits (e.g., digital images, ASCII-rendered DNA sequences, locked PDF files, specific versions of a particular database record [e.g. XML or RDF serialization of a database record], etc.)

__Conceptual ("Abstract") Entities__
   * Conceptualized "notions" of an object or event
   * No data content (null)
   * Serve as "hubs" to cluster and relate other GUID-tagged objects
   * Rarely exists without at least one Digital Byte Sequence GUID directly or indirectly linked

This group agreed to take on the task of developing a series of Wiki Pages to clarify the distinction between these two fundamental kinds of GUIDs, and to illustrate how both would be used within the biodiversity informatics community.
