@---++ The Info URI Specification

The "info" URI specification is being proposed as another uri standard for identification.  The library community has proposed the RFC behind "info" in order to standardize the representation of identifiers in common use within the library community (such as LLCNs and DOIs, among others).  The main page describing "info" URIs is:

  [[http://www.loc.gov/standards/uri/info.html]]

An "info" URI is defined to only be used for the purposes of identification, and explicitly not for resolution.

An "info" URI has the following syntax:
   "info:" namespace "/" identifier [ "#" fragment ]

where namespace is a registered namespace token, identifier is a %-escaped identifier, and fragment is an optional %-escaped identifier to a secondary resource.  See [[http://info-uri.info/registry/docs/misc/faq.html#simplifications][The Info FAQ]] for more details.

Some example "info" URIs:
   * info:lccn/2002022641
   * info:doi/10.1000.10/123456
   * info:sici/0363-0277(19950315)120:5%3C%3E1.0.TX;2-V
   * info:bibcode/2003Icar..163..263Z
   * info:pmid/12376099@
