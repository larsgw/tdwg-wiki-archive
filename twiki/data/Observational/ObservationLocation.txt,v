-- Main.SteveKelling - 10 Jul 2006

From Lynn Kutner's Document:

Location:

Ideally, at least geocoordinates plus an accuracy term. Since there is a considerable amount of historical / legacy data that does not presently have a georeference yet has valuable information that should be included in observation databases and shared, we cannot at this time require data to be in a GIS format.

Suggest:
a)	Location information be required, preferably geocoordinates and mapping precision, but if not available then a text description and the finest level of geolocation using the Darwin Core attributes.
b)	Location data include the representation of observations as point, line, or polygon data (with the necessary spatial metadata).@
