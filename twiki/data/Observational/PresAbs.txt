From Lynn Kutner's Document:

1)	Occurrence: 

"Occurrence" has been changed to "evidence for the presence or absence".

The key idea is that the organism or set of organisms was either detected or not. We also need to provide an opportunity for the recorder to note the certainty. As an aside, recall we need to support minimalist protocols (e.g. "organism/community (not) seen in field", "organism heard in field", "scat seen in field", "tracks seen in field", "museum collection") as well as situations when the protocol will equal &#8220;none&#8221;.
