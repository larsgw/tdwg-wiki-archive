Because of uncertainties surrounding the legal status of JPEG2000 (specifically the fear of submarine patents and patent trolling), it's unlikely that we'll see widespread adoption of the format on the web before 2020 (when most of the patents will have expired). After the endless patent litigation that surrounded the original JPEG format (which didn't end until 2008), most web software vendors are understandably wary of adopting new file formats. One area where JPEG2000 might be able to find some traction, however, is for extremely high resolution images (> 50 megapixel), where JPEG isn't as practical.
