---+ IIG Proposed CHARTER 
Material to be perhaps incorporated
This is a draft proposal for the TDWGImage Interest Group, IIG

An Interest Group is a precursor to a full TDWG Subgroup. It functions informally until there is sufficient mass to propose a full Subgroup.

*PROPOSED CHARTER, put up for comment!*

*1. NAME:* Image Intrest Group(IIG, a TDWG interest group)

*2. VERSION HISTORY* <br/>
Current Standard: No standards are yet proposed<br/>
Most Recent Version: <br/>
Working Draft Version: 

*3. CONVENER:* Robert A. Morris, Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts/Boston; 100 Morrissdey Blvd; Boston, MA 02125, USA Email: name [at] cs.umb.edu, replace "name" with "ram"

*4. CORE MEMBERS:* The wiki has been inactive since St. Petersburg, so I list here only people I know to be active in image management research: Robert A. Morris (UMASS-Boston), Reed Beaman(Yale), Greg Riccardi (Florida State University), Stinger Guala (USDA PLANTS).


*5. HOME ADDRESS:* [[http://wiki.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/TDWGImage/]]

*6. PURPOSE:* To seed the formation of a full TDWG Subgroup whose purpose would be:To develop standard computer-based mechanisms for managing and transferring descriptive information about media including metadata terminologies, ontologies, descriptions, file exchange formats, and associated resources.

*7. BACKGROUND:* Many TDWG members have an interest in images. The largest focus at the moment is digitization of specimens (not specimen records), but the increasing importance of observations, which often are documented by images, video, and audio, will lead to an ever greater demand for exchange standards, most notably for content metadata.

The interest group emerged following an informal brief meeting in Christchurch at the 2004 meeting, and a somewhat longer one at the 2005 meeting in St. Petersburg. The latter gave birth to the wiki at http://wiki.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/TDWGImage/


*8. SCOPE:* A full subgroup may be expected to be concerned with the following topics, at least
   * Descriptive content metadata
   * File formats, especially new standards such as JPEG2000
   * Standards for image GUID management and deployment
   * Best Practices for the acquisition, curation, and distribution of multimedia resources
   * Intellectual Property Rights
   * Outreach, e.g. workshops on image acquisition
   * Connections to other organizations involved with these topics to reduce duplication
   

*9. AUDIENCE:* Everybody concerned with any aspect of documenting the nature and occurence of organisms, and their behavior and interactions in biotic systems.


*10. OUTPUTS and OUTCOMES (and timeframe):* The formation of a full subgroup with an active wiki by June 1, 20007


*11. STRATEGY:* (What general approaches, principles or strategies are to be used by the group to achieve the outputs and outcomes): This needs a good hook, because everybody takes a lot of pictures, and few people do anything systematic with them. So the core group---if it agrees to be such---needs to brainstorm about strategies and seek advice from the TDWG executive committee.
