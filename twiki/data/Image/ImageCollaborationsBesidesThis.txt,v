	* A biological imaging Research Collaboration Network proposal has been submitted to the U.S. National Science Foundation. Most of the initiators attended the !BioImage04  and the followup meeting in Austin, Texas that founded [[http://www.imrsys.org/][IMRSYS]], _Interoperabilityof Media Resources in Systematics_.  

	* The European Biodiversity Information Network (ENBI) is producing a best practices manual for imaging specimens. Its drafts are at BDEI.ENBIManualManuscripts. The final version is expected late in 2005 in both electronic and paper formats, whereupon a link will be set here
