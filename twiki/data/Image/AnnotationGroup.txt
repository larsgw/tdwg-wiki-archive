---+++ Annotation Group
   * Jim Croft, Paul Morris, Austin Mast, Steve Winner, Debbie Paul
      * What follows is each of our notes from the 2-day Annotation Working Group meeting.
   * Scope: 
      * to discuss the current issues surrounding sharing annotations about images (and other objects),
      * suggest areas needing further investigation as well as...
      * point out the need to review other standards that already exist about making comments about digital images (so as to not re-invent...).

%GREEN% <H5> Paul Morris' notes: </H5> %ENDCOLOR%
   * 1) Taxon Name Issues
      * Important to track determination history
      * Important to tag names as published for the specimen
      * Pace of (online) determination may be higher than that for collection visits, more chance for disagreement among experts on determination, need for a structure for resolving disputes.  
      * Audit trail of actions resulting from annotations (generalized to all sorts of annotations (structure is not an antenna...).  
      * Record annotations
      * Record response of system to the annotation 
         * Name applied to image
         * Person disagrees and offers annotation with different name
         * System (automated or human) approves application of new name as current name
         * All three above need to be tracked.
      * DB to watch for annotations that flip flop repeatedly. 
      * __Recommendation__ &#8211; governance structure to include experts able to resolve disputes about the content.
         * Graphically highlight issues in dispute
         * Allow structured comments on issues
         * Allow easy thumbs up/thumbs down
   * 2) Control of annotations at entry point:
      * Tags &#8211; quick, easy, uncontrolled single input type=text box.
         * General Annotations. 
            * Useful for "new" species. 
            * Useful for ad hoc groupings of images.
      * Schema level control &#8211; text entry fields linked to concepts = text control over atomic field in a normalized database.
      * Ontology level control &#8211; picklist/autocomplete/validated data entry control with data entry limited by a controlled vocabulary.
      * What to capture? 
         * Text (like field notes), marked-up images (graphic/vector), ontologies?
      * Generalize &#8211; Annotate using controlled concepts using fields based on existing schemas, ontologies, etc.
   * 3) Likely scope of concepts in annotations: 
      * Largely or entirely covered by existing schemas, much less so by ontologies:
         * Dublin Core &#8211; authorship/creation date of annotation
         * DarwinCore/ABCD - specimen data
         * GML &#8211; locality polygons
         * StructuredDescriptiveData &#8211; character data
         * TaxonomicConceptSchema &#8211; determinations
         * Graphical presentation elements  ? SVG
         * ?3d/video/audio, annotation of non 2d image digital media files
         * Agree or disagree with another annotation.
   * 4)Presentation and scaling
      * Capture data early.
      * Client side &#8211; css positioning, javascript positioning
      * Server side &#8211; scripted image editing (imagemagick), serving images with mapping tools (mapserver, geoserver etc).  
   * 5) Related items discussed: Interface of the Flora of the SE US (Austin), Florabase (Jim), image/shape evaluation: MapServe, OpenGIS,  Flickr, Photosynth, Open Street Map
   * 6) Specimen issues: (from Deb) Jim pointed out the importance of being "clear" and "accurate"  about what one is annotating with his example of "gathering", "item,"  and "?" His group avoids using the term "specimen."
      * (from Paul): See history of collections database information models starting with Stan Blum's ACS model in the US and the European history behind ABCD &#8211; both use a generalized &#8220;collection object&#8221; concept to handle both specimen based and lot based collections and differing practices in the management of material in collections &#8211; concrete cases: herbarium sheet with specimens of more than one taxon affixed, multiple parts of the same plant spread over several herbarium sheets, multiple parts of the same mammal (skin, skeleton, tissue samples) having different preparation histories and storage locations, derived objects such as casts related to the collection objects from which they were made, bulk samples that may get picked and sorted into lots by higher taxonomic groups, which may be later sorted into lots determined to the species level.  Note not to confuse gathering with ABCD gathering event.
      * What is being annotated?   Specimen?  Image?  Group of images? 
         * Annotation is of a Set of one or more digital objects.
         * Annotating set of images as having same view &#8211; annotation user interface as means of creating an annotation and as a means of adding data to other parts of database.
      * Are there information standards for comments on digital objects?

   * Taxon Name Issues
      * Annotations with taxon names not matching local authority files. How to handle?
      * Capture old "legacy" (Determination) annotations as well as "online" annotations in such a way that the data can be shared & associated with the identification.
      * Capturing the "Taxon Concept" if possible.
         * What fields would be needed for this?
         * What format?
         * Capture original name/s on specimen
            * Relate names to Taxon Concept, as in name=, name is unresolvable, name is ambiguous, name includes, name is included...
      * U-Bio separates the Name Classification from the Taxon ID String. Everyone can use the classification that best fits their world view.
      * Taxon Concept needs to be tied to fields in the Determination Annotation (ABCD, SDD, ...)
      * Ask the person creating the Identification to identify the resources used to make the Identification (Image, DNA, Key, ...)
      * Some Authentication process: Name of the Annotator and Time Stamp
   * Need a way to change the name associated with a specimen is the expert says the specimen is something other than the most recent determination.
      * Must keep the history of name changes
   * Possible solution to Schema Issues for Annotations is to allow each user to choose the Schema (and therefore the most relevant fields for their purpose).
   * How to store the Annotations made to/on images?
      * Mapping and Map Layers / 2-3D SVG Standards
         * Graphics vs. Vectoring
      * Store annotation  as SVG version or map (graphic) version
         * Allow user to choose
   * Are there Standards for graphical display of information? Are there Standards about making comments about digital images?
      * Is there a subset of standards specific to graphics?

%GREEN% Attributes of an Annotation %ENDCOLOR%
   * Type of Annotation
      * General
      * Determination
      * Handwriting
   * Schema or Ontology Used  (e.g. TCSB)
   * Annotator
      * Validation of right to make the annotation (Authentication Process)
      * Might the Annotator want to remain anonymous? What if they are a reviewer?
      * If someone annotates, should anonymity even be an option? How could the community rate/weight the value of the annotation if the annotator's name is not present.
      * Could use a "flag" to "Display Annotator" or not. The system would capture the name of the annotator, but not display it?
   * Date & Time of Annotation
   * Digital Object being Annotated
      * Using LSID? (to reference digital object in Morphbank)
         * Yes, an annotation could be added to this object
   * Area of interest
      * point/s of interest highlighted
   * Annotation Conditions: e.g. The annotation event took place while the researcher was coding a character or perhaps creating a collection...
      * helps researcher and future researchers to understand the context of the event and why a particular comment is made or conclusion is reached.
   * Content of Annotation: allowing users to have flexibility; reaching out to use as many different standards are possible (GML, SDD, ...)
   * Relationship/s between objects: is a part of, is included in...
      * examples include: protein derived from, DNA derived from, illustration to image to a pollen image
   * Resource/s the Annotator uses to make an annotation (a microscope, a key, DNA, ...)
   * Graphical Elements added to the Object (circles, squares, arrows) by annotation
   * Meta-annotation: a review process in place (by Morphbank or...) to prevent spurious annotations (ex. "Viagra").

Work Flow Issues of Annotations
   * 3rd Party viewer, does original person accept the annotation, who is the "original person" if there are multiple annotations, what happens after an annotation is made?
      * Project Kepler mentioned but Kepler is experiment-based
      * USE CASE may be sharing annotations between Harvard Herbaria and Morphbank, SDD being captured, what concepts are available for exchange are known

Look at 
   * Specify and fields present there for Determination Annotations
   * MX System

Idea that a Specimen has a "curator"

GBIF - may help to set up standards to oversee governance of Morphbank resolving issues like how to handle annotations
