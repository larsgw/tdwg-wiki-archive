---+!! Publish Web Plugin

Utility to publish a TWiki web to static HTML pages. Useful to maintain a static website collaboratively in an access restricted TWiki.

%TOC%

---++ Description and Syntax Rules

One web (defined in the PUBLISHWEBNAME setting) serves as the master for the static HTML pages. The Plugin generates an HTML pages every time a user saves a topic in the Publish web. The static HTML files are based on a TWiki skin of choice. All referred attachments (images etc) are copied to a publish directory.

---+++ Topics and Links
   * The home topic is assumed to be =Index=
   * Topic names: For clarity, use capitalized words and underscores (%TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord names are possible too)
   * All links should be defined as double square bracket links, e.g. =[<nop>[Topic]]= or =[<nop>[Topic][label]]= (do not use %TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord links)

#PublishProcess
---+++ Publish process
<form action="%SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#PublishProcess">
   * A static HTML page is generated for exery topic saved in the %PUBLISHWEBNAME% web (unless listed in the EXCLUDETOPIC setting)
   * Topic names get converted to a lowercase filename, e.g. =Index= to =index.html=, =AboutUs= to =aboutus.html=, and =Customer_Support= to =customer_support.html=
   * Only text between =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= and =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= is used (the whole text if missing)
   * !WikiWord links are ignored, also across webs
   * Page layout is based on the skin defined in the PUBLISHSKIN setting
   * Topics can be re-published without an edit/save cycle.%BR%
     Topic:
     <select name="tname">
     <option value="">select...</option>
     <option>all</option>
     %TOPICLIST{ web="%PUBLISHWEBNAME%" format="<option>$name</option>" separator=" " }% </select>
     <input type="hidden" name="action" value="publish" />
     <input type="submit" value="Publish" />
     [[%SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#PublishProcess][Clear]]%BR%
     %PUBLISHWEB{ "%URLPARAM{ "action" }%" topic="%URLPARAM{ "tname" }%" }%
</form>

---+++ Variables
   * =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= - place in topic text where to start publishing
      * Optional, start from top if missing
   * =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= - place in topic text where to stop publishing
      * Optional, publish to end of topic if missing
   * =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%= - nice topic name
      * Shows a "nice" topic name of the current topic: Underscores in topic names are rendered as space; the Index topic is rendered with the HOMELABEL Plugin setting
      * Example: Topic =Customer_Support= turns into =Customer Support=
   * =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= - nice breadcrumb
      * The breadcrumb is based on the parent child relationship of topics, starting at the Index topic
      * The breadcrumb does _not_ include the current topic, append =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%= to get the complete breadcrumb
      * The skin may contain a =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= variable to show the breadcrumb
      * Underscores in topic names are rendered as space
      * Example: =You are here: <u>Home</u> &gt; <u>Customer Support</u> &gt;=
   * =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"publish" topic="Name"}%= - re-publish topic(s) without edit/save cycle
      * Useful to refresh all HTML pages if the skin has been modified
      * A =topic="all"= publishes all topics in the Publish web except for the excluded ones
      * A =topic="Any_Topic"= publishes a specific topics

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>PUBLISHWEBPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

   * One line description, is shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:

      * Set DEBUG = 0

   * Web to publish:
      * Set PUBLISHWEBNAME = BDI.SDD_.Primer

   * Skin to use to publish:
      * Set PUBLISHSKIN = static

   * Exclude topics from publishing:
      * Set EXCLUDETOPIC = WebPublish, WebChanges, WebHome, WebIndex, WebLeftBar, WebNotify, WebPreferences, WebAtom, WebRss, WebSearchAdvanced, WebSearch, WebStatistics, WebTopicList

   * Home label, used in =%<nop>PUBLISHBREADCRUMB%=:
      * Set HOMELABEL = Home

         * This should generate an =test.html= page on topic save
         * Create =Index= topic and other topics
   * Publish skin:
      * Create a new publish skin based on your branding. The [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiSkins][TWiki skin]] can be derived from any =twiki/templates/view.*.tmpl= skin file
