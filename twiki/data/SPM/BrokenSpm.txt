*Markus has resolved the issue below as of SVN rev 1392 for !SpeciesProfileModel.rdf and 1393 for !SPMInfoItems.rdf* -- Main.BobMorris - 08 Jul 2008


-- Main.BobMorris - 02 Jul 2008
Per observation of Sep 22 by Gregor(?), the files !SpeciesProfileModel.rdf and !SPMInfoItems.rdf have overlap as of 9/22/2007. They also have a few other issues deserving of discussion, before fixing

   * Besides the duplicate InfoItem classes, these classes appear in !SpeciesProfileModel.rdf  but do not appear in !SPMInfoItems.rdf
      * spm:Biology   --- probably meant to be same as spmt:TaxonBiology and so is superfluous
      * spm:Conservation
      * spm:Description  ---has a spurious(?) subclass spm:Size
      * spm:Ecology
      * spm:Use --- probably meant to be same as spmt:Uses; I think the singular is better since can have repeated InfoItems



As a trivial aside, I'd rather see the !SPMInfoItem namespace be called
spmi  than spmt.  It is just a little more mnemonic in the case where
applications that import the class happen to assign the same prefix as
is in the file.  My Protege 3.3.1 assigned its own namespace prefix. I
don't know why---some configuration maybe---

The attached two files address the overlap problem by moving all !SPMInfoItems into !SPMInfoItems.rdf. They leave the above unaddressed.
