An example from Marcus:

With his permission, I have (a)added Marcus's [[http://ww3.bgbm.org/tmp/abiesalba.rdf][original file]] to the UMB SVN [[http://gentoo.cs.umb.edu/svn/TDM/Abies][SPM example repository]]; (b)added some SVN tags; (c)uploaded it here for persistance; and (d) (without asking him)added some owl imports to the file so that visualization tools can make a little more of it and Protege is happier. I also attached [[%ATTACHURL%/abiesalba.png][a  visualization]] produced by Altova !SemanticWorks.  -- Bob Morris - 19 Jun 2007


Comments from Marcus:

some things that struck me when writing this example:

   * where do I put a PublicationCitation? I would want to cite all sources for every information and I don't know where/how. Is this missing or part of the base/core ontology already?
   * hasInformation is a bit redundant, but the validator did complain when I declared all InfoItems under a single hasInformation node. Was this intended? I guess yes, cause otherwise the InfoItems would have to be properties.
   * controlled vocabularies need to be derived from DefinedTerm which is TDWG specific. How can I reuse existing vocabularies like for example an ISO country list?


Comments from Éamonn:

I think the original intention was to be able to cite the source for each infoItem. Is it not possible to just pull in a tp:PublicationCitation under every spm:hasInformation or spmi element when you want to cite a source for its content, rather like you did for tn:TaxonName? 

Later: 
The LSID Vocabularies - Globals (http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/Common.rdf) includes an ObjectProperty "publishedInCitation", so I guess SPM infoItems ontology (http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems.rdf) can inherit from that.
