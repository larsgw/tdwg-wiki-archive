[[http://plazi.org Plazi]] is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing open scientific literature. Its main project at the moment is the development of tools for automation of extraction of information from publications, whether scanned or born digital, and web services for applying and providing such information. This page is discusses an effort underway to use SPM to serve species descriptions, and related data from systematics literature. The work is funded by the Encyclopedia of Life and administered by GBIF and carried out for [[http://plazi.org Plazi]] by Main.TerryCatapano and Main.BobMorris. It builds on work originally funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation at the American Museum of Natural History and the University of Massachusetts/Boston.

<strike>This is a complete rewrite and synthesis reflecting our understanding as of Oct 10 2008 and onward. It addresses remarks, answers, and questions made in earlier versions by Main.RogerHyam and Main.PatrickLeary and ourselves, including some simple things we were doing wrong. </strike> As of Jan 22, 2009 and onward, all the issues raised in earlier versions of this page have been addressed and the service described below is complete, subject only to some tuning. The discussion leading to it can be found by examining the history, and is also frozen at PlaziSPMDiscussion. Thanks to Roger and Patrick for their comments.

The actual RDF vocabularies at issue can be found at [[http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SpeciesProfileModel.rdf]] and [[http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems.rdf]]

---+Plazi Report To GBIF and EOL
PlaziFinalReport
---+Plazi SPM REST service
As of 22 January, we offer a REST service requiring the user to choose one of two serializations, described below.  The full api for the REST service follows those descriptions. In all cases, the document is returned as RDF/XML conforming to the definition of SPM. The API described below controls the content and rendering format of the spm:hasContent elements, which is what most clients will be inserting into their applications.

Base URL:

http://plazi.cs.umb.edu/exist/rest/db/taxonx_docs/getSPM.xq

Required Parameters:

   * &doc=[document name] This parameter sets the document to be retrieved as SPM

   * Use one of each pair of following parameters:
      * &description:
         * &description=narrow  This parameter imposes  a narrow view of what consitutes an spmi:Description. It extracts from a publication only the classical description, i.e. the characters and states that describe the taxon under consideration, for insertion into the appropriate spm:hasContent element.
         * &description=broad This parameter imposes a broad view of an spmi:Description. Application of it in the REST service results in all of the sections of a treatment returned, e.g. _materials examined_, _description_, _diagnosis_, _etymology_, etc., separated from one another in ways that identify them. These appear in the appropriate spm:hasContent element. For future work we will propose a controlled vocabulary for these parts of a treatment so that they can be marked up more explicitly in RDF.
      * &render:   
         * &render=text  The spm:hasContent items are plain text, with paragraphs separated by white space.
         * &render=xhtml The spm:hasContent items are xhtml with character entities require escaping.  This rendering will require that a client filters the escaped entities, particularly the xhtml escaped brackets, to turn it into xhtml suitable for browsers.
      * &associations:   
         * &associations=yes  For each taxon name appearing in the treatment of the described taxon an spm:associatedTaxon is created inside an spmi:Associations
         * &associations=no  No information about associated taxa is returned


Other changes

   * added dc:rights with string "Not copyrightable" added to spm:SpeciesProfileModel
   * added an spm:associatedTaxon for each taxon name in the treatment serving as source of each spm:SpeciesProfileModel
   * added xml comments for revision number of xsl stylesheet converting from taxonX to SPM and timestamp for date and time of transformation

---+ Generally Current Example

Click below for an example generated by the current, live SPM server.  Many browsers do not reveal the tags in RDF/XML, so you may have to do "View Source" in your browser to see them.

This is a complete rewrite and synthesis reflecting our understanding as of Oct 10 2008 and onward. It addresses remarks, answers, and questions made in earlier versions by Main.RogerHyam and Main.PatrickLeary and ourselves, including some simple things we were doing wrong. Thanks to Roger and Patrick for their comments.

---+ SPM issues

---++Why SPM at all?
Patrick asked: Since a !TaxonConcept supports hasInformation, why wrap anything in a !SpeciesProfileModel?

We don't have an answer to this. Indeed it seems as though 
<verbatim>
<spm:SpeciesProfileModel rdf:ID="_spm_1">
        <spm:aboutTaxon>
            <tc:TaxonConcept rdf:about="urn:lsid:biosci.ohio-state.edu:osuc_concepts:135414">
                ....
            </tc:TaxonConcept>
        </spm:aboutTaxon>
        <spm:hasInformation>
             blah, blah, blah
        </spm:hasInformation>

</spm:SpeciesProfileModel>

</verbatim>
have exactly the same information content and semantics as 

<verbatim>
<tc:TaxonConcept rdf:about="urn:lsid:biosci.ohio-state.edu:osuc_concepts:135414">
                ....
       <spm:hasInformation>
             blah, blah, blah
        </spm:hasInformation>
 </tc:TaxonConcept>
</verbatim>

        
       
---++Where to put citation?

!TaxonConcept has a property accordingTo, with value Actor. Actor has !CommonProperties.  !CommonProperties has a data property !PublishedIn and object property !PublishedInCitation which has range !PublicationCitation. That is where we put it. This seems cumbersome to us, but for our application, in a given document, every described !TaxonConcept  arises from extraction from a single journal publication, so we only need one such  Actor and !PublicationCitation. We refer to it in each !TaxonConcept.accordingTo if there is more than one.

Is there something better to do?


---++Where to put LSID?

Answer, as Main.RogerHyam patiently pointed out: In an rdf:about on any object that needs one, especially !TaxonConcept and perhaps !PublishedInCitation when people start issuing LSIDs for journal articles. This seems to have two minor costs, mentioned next.

---++External references
A realistic use case for plazi involves external documents whose creators wish to make assertions that stuff in an SPM document is wrong. That is   because plazi is extracting data from published literature, often originating in printed media, which may go through several processes subject to error. These include, imaging, OCR, semi-automated markup, and various transformations of the marked up data. Any of these might introduce errors that client applications may be able to detect and signal. Local IDs, especially with care about the xml:base, explicitly reify the RDF/XML object that they ID in a way that makes it easy to refer to them externally. But it doesn't look like absolute URIs such as required by rdf:about do so, so we don't presently know how to address support for external documents commenting upon the data in objects which have been given an rdf:about.  A small example will be forthcoming here. 

---++Other GUIDS
Journal publications, and perhaps other resources (e.g. people), may have other GUID schemes besides LSID in use to identify them  Thus  a resource may have several GUIDS (even several LSIDs).  It therefore might be convenient if several GUIDs could be attached to a single object, e.g. the same !PublishedInCitation or the same !TaxonConcept.  

As of 10 October 2008, we haven't thought of a good way to handle this.

---++More use of controlled vocabulary
One thing that I would like to see included is the use of tn:rank in addition to tn:rankString. It is always good as a consumer to get content in the form of a controlled vocabulary rather than trying to reconcile varying rankStrings which mean the same thing. -- Main.PatrickLeary - 30 Sep 2008

%GREEN%
In email to Terry I raised that  point as follows:

I wonder how much effort it would be in the XSLT to embed the rank
terms from http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonRank#TaxonRankTerm
into the XSLT style sheet and if the tn:rankString you construct
matches one of the controlled strings, then also construct a tn:rank
object as well as a tn:rankString. I'm not entirely sure what is
gained from this, except that machine processing becomes more robust
and less dependent on string parsing.  Issues that would arise in that
case include:
   * What should a happen if there is no match?
   * What breaks if the controlled tn:rank vocabulary changes?
-- Main.BobMorris - 01 Oct 2008 %ENDCOLOR%


---++ Where to put IPR and how to represent it?

%BLUE%
In RDF everything that is not a literal is a resource that is identified by a local id (possibly implied by the serialization) or a URI. It is therefore possible to assert licensing about any resource in an RDF graph simply by adding a dc:license or dc:rights property to it. The problem is with thinking in terms of XML serializations where it doesn't appear there is space for adding extra attributes.
-- RogerHyam - 6 Oct 2008 %ENDCOLOR%

My concern is whether this remains valid OWL-DL -- Main.BobMorris - 10 Oct 2008

Exactly how to represent it is really about the TDWG ontology in general, not something special to SPM or even citations.  There was extensive discussion of what is and isn't copyrighted, what licenses apply, etc. That can be seen in an earlier version of this page and/or in such page as someone cares to link here. -- Main.BobMorris - 10 Oct 2008

---++ Line breaks and other document formatting
Patrick notes that there are no line breaks in the Descriptions plazi extracts and asks: 

Is there some way to include line breaks - either using embedded escaped html or ensuring that newlines represent line breaks? -- Main.PatrickLeary - 30 Sep 2008

%GREEN% I am somewhere between nervous about,  and opposed to,  putting spurious (or any) html inside rdf.  Most formatting  chas no semantic content. In an extracted taxonomic description, formatting artefacts, especially from scanned documents, are just about the original rendition layout.  A description might even have a page break in it, and in principle could even be interrupted by a figure (though I doubt any journal publisher would actually do that). Also, I think we don't even preserve any line breaks in !TaxonX, whence we are grabbing descriptions whose boundaries are determined by a !GoldenGate plugin. (Am I right Terry?). I guess that if there is escaped HTML in the text, then it remains as a string literal, but then it is going to be the client's responsibility to scan, parse, and interpret it.  I don't have a full comprehension of http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#section-XMLLiteral but I think it may apply if you want some more robust XHTML in the text, rather than an uninterpreted escape sequence.

There _are_ some structural divisions identified by !GoldenGate within a description, but pending more sophisticated automatic markup than anybody does to date, it is not yet possible to put any semantics automatically on those divisions, and using them seems ugly and confusing.  See the Sep 23 example, which we abandoned.  -- Main.BobMorris - 01 Oct 2008 %ENDCOLOR%

GoldenGate currently marks up subsections within the treatment such as nomenclature (required for the taxonx output), ref-groups that include earlier citations of the taxon and as well nomenclatorial changes such as "new syn", Stat.nov." which relate the refs to the name of the treatment), description, discussion, materials_examined (the observation records listed), distribution (a summary of distribution records and its interpretation). Some of the elements are not always clear and can include several elements. But we do this mark-up routinely, and the GoldenGate editor is getting pretty efficient to figure out what section belongs to what item above.-- Main.DonatAgosti - 02 Oct 2008

---++ Namespace termination
It is pretty important to terminate namespace values with either '/' or '#'.  Although failing to do so is valid  RDF/XML serialization, it can result in ambiguity in the triple form of the RDF, wherein local name is concatenated with namespace to form resource names. Here's a good NamespaceTermination example from Adobe's XMP manual.

As of 30 Nov 2008, we offer a REST service requiring the user to choose one of two serializations, described below.  The full api for the REST service follows those descriptions. In all cases, the document is returned as RDF/XML conforming to the definition of SPM. The API described below controls the content and rendering format of the spm:hasContent elements, which is what most clients will be inserting into their applications.

Edit above this line please

Ignore this please ... Bob Morris

As of 30 Nov 2008, we offer a REST service requiring the user to choose one of two serializations, described below.  The full api for the REST service follows those descriptions. In all cases, the document is returned as RDF/XML conforming to the definition of SPM. The API described below controls the content and rendering format of the spm:hasContent elements, which is what most clients will be inserting into their applications.
d120 1
a120 3
   1 &doc=[document name] This parameter sets the document to be retrieved as SPM

Use one of each pair of following parameters:
d122 1
a122 1
&description:
d124 13
a136 9
   1  &description=narrow  This parameter imposes  a narrow view of what consitutes an spmi:Description. It extracts from a publication only the classical description, i.e. the characters and states that describe the taxon under consideration, for insertion into the appropriate spm:hasContent element.
   1 &description=broad This parameter imposes a broad view of an spmi:Description. Application of it in the REST service results in all of the sections of a treatment returned, e.g. _materials examined_, _description_, _diagnosis_, _etymology_, etc., separated from one another in ways that identify them. These appear in the appropriate spm:hasContent element. For future work we will propose a controlled vocabulary for these parts of a treatment so that they can be marked up more explicitly in RDF.

&render:

   1 &render=text  The spm:hasContent items are plain text, with paragraphs separated by white space.
   1 &render=xhtml The spm:hasContent items are xhtml with character entities require escaping.  This rendering will require that a client filters the escaped entities, particularly the xhtml escaped brackets, to turn it into xhtml suitable for browsers.

As of 21 Nov 2008, we offer a REST service requiring the user to choose one of two  XSL style sheets, described below.  The full api for the REST service follows those descriptions.
d236 1
a236 2
   1   SS1.xsl  This style sheet imposes  a narrow view of what consitutes an spmi:Description. It extracts from a publication only the classical description, i.e. the characters and states that describe the taxon under consideration.
   1 SS1.xsl This style sheet imposes a broad view of an spmi:Description. Application of it in the REST service results in all of the sections of a treatment returned, e.g. _materials examined_, _description_, _diagnosis_, _etymology_, etc., separated from one another in ways that identify them. For future work we will propose a controlled vocabulary for these parts of a treatment
d238 1
a238 3
In addition to the current choice of style sheets providing differnt views as above, we also support two rendering choices given by a key named _render_ with values one of:
   1 _text_  This is plain text, with paragraphs separated by white space.
   1 _xhtml_ This is xhtml with character entities require escaping.  This rendering will require that a client filters the escaped entities, particularly the xhtml escaped brackets, to turn it into xhtml suitable for browsers.

!TaxonConcept has a property accordingTo, with value Actor. Actor has !CommonProperties; !CommonProperties has a data property !PublishedIn and object property !PublishedInCitation which has range !PublicationCitation. This seems cumbersome to us, but in our application, in a given document, every described !TaxonConcept is arises from extraction from a single journal publication. We cite that once (i.e. we have a single Actor and !PublicationCitation),  refer to it in each !TaxonConcept.accordingTo if there is more than one !TaxonConcept in the document, as is usually the case.

%GREEN% I am somewhere between nervous about,  and opposed to,  putting spurious (or any) html inside rdf.  Many formatting artefacts certainly have no semantic content. In an extracted description are just about the paper rendition layout.  A description might even have a page break in it, and in principle could even be interrupted by a figure (though I doubt any journal publisher would actually do that). Also, I think we don't even preserve any line breaks in !TaxonX, whence we are grabbing descriptions whose boundaries are determined by a !GoldenGate plugin. (Am I right Terry?). I guess that if there is escaped HTML in the text, then it remains as a string literal, but then it is going to be the client's responsibility to scan, parse, and interpret it.  I don't have a full comprehension of http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#section-XMLLiteral but I think it may apply if you want some more robust XHTML in the text, rather than an uninterpreted escape sequence.

Some of these are already types appearing in !PublicationCitation and care may be needed to guarantee consistency if a new usage of those is adopted.

Two problems here. Using LSID's for rdf:ID causes error because it is not of the XML Name datatype. That's not a big deal as we can change the strings to make them valid. The bigger problem is the second problem. Are we really to make *all* assertions about the same rdf:ID under the same element? Is rdf:ID like xsd:id and id'ing an element, not a concept? Should we be using something like rdf:about for this purpose?

---
I believe rdf:ID is simply a node id unique in the rdf graph, which for RDF/XML would seem to translate to your first conclusion: it is an id on the element. I'm not sure what would be meant by an _RDF concept_. In the pantheon of languages expressed in RDF, RDF has properties, but no Classes. Those are defined in RDFS, the next layer up. I guess most people would say that an rdfs:Class defines a concept (whose circumscription is all the things which have that class as their datatype.).  Given this, I would say that there is no other conclusion but that rdf:id is id'ing an element. 

I think rdf:about is not any better for what you may be trying to do. rdf:about is used most often as an attribute of rdf:Description. As above, you can't  describe classes purely in RDF, so either we have to escalate to rdfs, which is probably not profitable, or we try to solve the problem entirely in the TDWG lsid vocabularies, which are all in the OWL layer (and in particular, have plenty of classes defined). 

Is the issue really  how do we make assertions about the Taxon Concept behind the lsid? (as opposed to the lsid, which itself is just an rdf literal, and not much worth describing. In fact lsid's are supposed to be semantically opaque). To get the TC behind an lsid requires resolution. This makes me worry that if we know an lsid, we may have to do the resolution on the way to constructing the SPM....that sounds nasty, and also needs a failover strategy in case the lsid does not resolve, its contract notwithstanding. It also seems to require that the lsid resolution actually presents a TDWG !TaxonConcept object expressed in (or convertible to) lsid voc.

It may be that the only way out is that the lsid's we can discover or generate are simply the content (or value) of another InfoItem. In turn, that might require a new class of InfoItem named, e.g. LSID.

---+++ New Proposal: 17 Sep 2008

On ObsoletePlaziExamples in his proposal of 17 Sep 2008, Main.TerryCatapano comments:

based on reading of RDF Syntax Spec http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar

rdf:id's function is to reify triples and extends base url given in xml:base (which is the uri of the rdf doc?)

using rdf:about to specify that taxon concept LSID is the subject of the SPM

use rdf:resource to specify that the concept LSID is the concept of the about LSID -- not sure about this as it is recursive (A has concept A)?

This at least validates, however.

Main.ChuckMiller asks:

Why can't you use the accordingToString property for TaxonConcept to solve this problem? Like this

Main.BobMorris replies:

There's nothing wrong with this (well, nothing that isn't also a problem with the part of Terry's 17 Sep proposal. See below). However, it doesn't address the original, somewhat technical, problem Terry raised on Sep 6.  That problem was essentially "How is it assured that the different elements of a !SpeciesProfileModel object all refer to the same taxon concept in the face of the fact that rdf:ID values must be unique in the document?" Terry's s proposed solution on Sep 17 is that rdf:ID not the right mechanism to solve the problem, since it is meant to identify an element in the document, not to identify stuff that the element is talking about. Instead, the appropriate thing to do is add an  rdf:resource attribute and hang the LSID there. I think the main reason this is an issue at all is that an SPM can discuss other taxon concepts besides the one it is about. This use of rdf:resource seems to be the approach of most of the TDWG-based examples on the TDWG lsid resolver proxy service described at http://lsid.tdwg.org/. 

I see these problems remaining:

   * It's unclear to me that the current TDWG ontology definitions even allow for attributes to be hung on a the tc:TaxonConcept in the first place (or on any other defined rdf element for that matter...).  I wonder if this means that while the proposed SPM is valid RDF, it may not be valid OWL. %BLUE% As a TaxonConcept is a resource then it has a URI or local node id and so any assertion can be made about it (it can be the subject of a triplet). I don't understand why you don't understand otherwise I would say it another way to try and help -- RogerHyam - 6 Oct 2008 %BLACK%
   * What semantics is imposed on rdf:resource whose value is the lsid of  a tc:TaxonConcept that would insure that relevant string data in the resolved !TaxonConcept is in any way related (preferably is the same as) the string data offered in the document.  Unless the document string data were generated by _resolving_ the lsid (and maybe even then if the TC object is returned in the lsid metadata and not its data)  there can be no such guarantee. Indeed, the Hymenoptera Name Server lsids return everything in the metadata. The lsid might resolve to something that is not even meaningfully the same as the one described by the string data.  I raised that problem when the original Sep 6 issue was raised. %BLUE% Are you talking about receiving data from different sources that describe the same thing? If so then it is up to the client to track where it receives assertions from and whether it trusts those sources. This would be done using named graphs typically. It is exactly the same problem as merging any two documents. -- RogerHyam - 6 October 2008 %BLACK%

-- Main.BobMorris - 19 Sep 2008

OK, Terry and I are in agreement (and a little chagrined at getting it wrong) that Roger is completely right that it is appropriate to use rdf:about on objects and that this presents no issues within the generated document. We do this now. It does leave us with a separate, smaller, issue that puzzles us and which is a little relevant to what plazi's SPM is supposed to do. Hopefully this is as easy and we simply still overlook something simple. This is about reification and reference in external documents whose creators wish to make assertions that stuff in an SPM document is wrong. This is a realistic use-case because plazi is extracting data from published literature, often originating in printed media, which may go through several processes, (e.g. imaging, OCR, semi-automated markup, and various transformations of the marked up data) any of which might introduce errors that client applications might be able to detect and signal. Local IDs, especially with care about the xml:base, explicitly reify the RDF/XML object they ID in a way that makes it easy to refer to them externally. But it doesn't look like absolute URIs such as required by rdf:about do so, so we don't presently know how to address this.  A small example will be forthcoming here.   -- Main.BobMorris - 08 Oct 2008

---++ Namespace termination
It is pretty important to terminate namespace values with either '/' or '#'.  Although failing to do so is valid  RDF/XML serialization, it can result in ambiguity in the triple form of the RDF, wherein local name is concatenated with namespace to form resource names. Here's a good NamespaceTermination example from Adobe's XMP manual.

I have looked through this latest example and yesterday talked with Bob Morris about some outstanding issues (or uncertainty on my part) with this last version (24 September - see attached). One issue that remains vital to EOL is that of intellectual property and licensing. I raised the issue that there is no statement of licensing of the content being shared. Bob was of the idea that biological descriptions are statements of fact and are not intellectual property, therefore they cannot be licensed. I am not an IP lawyer so have asked that EOL look into this. I would be interested to see how licensing would appear if the description shared were in fact intellectual property.  EOL will need to make recommendations on what standards to use and how to use them, and some content partners will want to share text that is copyrighted.
d51 1
a51 1
I raised the question of how do we cite the descriptions. I see that each spm:SpeciesProfileModel has a spm:aboutTaxon which should ultimately reference a PublicationCitation with publishedIn. I can see that we can clearly cite the source of the taxon concept, but can we always infer that the publishedIn for the taxon is the same source of the description? What if I write a description on my own website, but cite person X's concept of the organism? Either way, it would be great to have a clear statement about the recommended way to infer the proper way to attribution statement for the description. This is also important for EOL and very important for those contributing content of their own. -- Main.PatrickLeary - 30 Sep 2008
d53 2
a54 1
%GREEN% Possibly this discussion belongs in some other venue. It doesn't seem unique to SPM. To the extent that a data provider asserts that their data are not subject to copyright because not creative works, we need a machine-readable mechanism that signals this---perhaps with a reason,---so that an application can choose whether to republish the data. -- Main.BobMorris - 01 Oct 2008 %ENDCOLOR%
d56 2
a57 1
Regarding Patrick's comment about Bob's comment "Bob was of the idea that biological descriptions are statements of fact and are not intellectual property, therefore they cannot be licensed."  The SPM needs to be capable of capturing the attribution data associated with the content and this attribution data can vary a lot.  We can't just jump to the conclusion that all content is a fact and therefore unattributed.  In science, I might think there is nothing that should be unattributed.  This is different than "copyrighted".  Content can be attributed without being copyrighted.  For instance, there are plenty of authors of public domain content who get attribution.  Can we address this area as "attribution" versus "intellectual property"?  Some content attributions are in fact for copyright, others are not. How can the fact of a "some rights reserved" license like Creative Commons be included with the object? SPM should be capable to include all of the needed data elements to capture the attribution facts of the content.  For the EOL's dataObject in its Transfer Schema, this has led to the use of new "agent" elements with roles of Source, Author, Project, and Publisher, combined with the elements dc:Rights, dcterms:RightsHolder,  dcterms:bibliographicCitation, and dc:source. Also dc:description is used for the actual text content. We need to be able to include attribution facts in the SPM along with the scientific facts.-- Main.ChuckMiller - 01 Oct 2008
d59 1
d61 1
a63 8
%BLUE%

In RDF everything that is not a literal is a resource that is identified by a local id (possibly implied by the serialization) or a URI. It is therefore possible to assert licensing about any resource in an RDF graph simply by adding a dc:license or dc:rights property to it. The problem is with thinking in terms of XML serializations where it doesn't appear there is space for adding extra attributes.

Note for Plazi: there are no line breaks in the text in this document. It seems that newlines in the descriptions do not represent line breaks (see #_Description_2_1).

GoldenGate currently marks up subsections within the treatment such as nomenclature (required for the taxonx output), ref-groups that include earlier citations of the taxon and as well nomenclatorial changes such as "new syn", Stat.nov." which relate the refs to the name of the treatment), description, discussion, materials_examined (the observation records listed), distribution (a summary of distribution records and its interpretation). Some of the elements are not always clear and can include several elements. But we do this mark-up routinely, and the GoldenGate editor is getting pretty efficient to figure out what section belongs to what item above.

I have been playing with this latest example a bit more today and have some new questions. The taxonConcepts use tc:hasInformation to point to the resource which describe the taxonConcept, but according to the standard tx:hasInformation should point to an infoItem, not a taxonConcept. So, is this invalid at this point? -- Main.PatrickLeary - 30 Sep 2008
a109 1
%GREEN%Yep, you are right. Will fix in next release.  We have to set up an OWL validator to catch stuff like this.....  We are just using it as a place to hang the LSID of the taxonConcept.   Terry and I talked about where to hang the LSID and this seemed appropriate. Have to check whether it is still OWL valid....   In general, I want to raise in Fremantle whether there are or should be best practices about where to squirrel LSIDs.-- Main.BobMorris - 01 Oct 2008  %ENDCOLOR%
a111 1
I also have a bit of a naive question, but one I would like to understand. SpeciesProfileModel contains two main elements which are of class taxonConcept and infoItem. The SPM element I suppose binds these two elements. But, if taxonConcept contains a hasInformation element, which is also an infoItem - couldn't we just have one RDF document which contains a bunch of taxonConcepts which have zero to many infoItems? In this latest example there are several SPM elements which only contain an aboutTaxon and it seems a bit unnecessary to have this extra SPM wrapper. I would be just as happy having a bunch of taxonConcepts, some of which contain infoItems.-- Main.PatrickLeary - 30 Sep 2008

   * It's unclear to me that the current TDWG ontology definitions even allow for attributes to be hung on a the tc:TaxonConcept in the first place (or on any other defined rdf element for that matter...).  I wonder if this means that while the proposed SPM is valid RDF, it may not be valid OWL.
   * What semantics is imposed on rdf:resource whose value is the lsid of  a tc:TaxonConcept that would insure that relevant string data in the resolved !TaxonConcept is in any way related (preferably is the same as) the string data offered in the document.  Unless the document string data were generated by _resolving_ the lsid (and maybe even then if the TC object is returned in the lsid metadata and not its data)  there can be no such guarantee. Indeed, the Hymenoptera Name Server lsids return everything in the metadata. The lsid might resolve to something that is not even meaningfully the same as the one described by the string data.  I raised that problem when the original Sep 6 issue was raised.

The !TaxonConcept RDF at http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonConcept does not appear to support any property for the publication in which the accordingTo, e.g. in an SPM aboutTaxon,  may have appeared. Discussion should cross reference the TDWG [[http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonConcept !TaxonConcept DiscussionPage]]

---++ Deprecation of tc:rankString
---+++ Example of 23 September 2008

Some changes:

   * SPM doc itself is subject of spm:SpeciesProfileModel (via xml:base)
   * no non-referenced namespace declarations
   * an spmi:Description now for each *paragraph* under a tax:Description element
   * spm:aboutTaxon now includes tc:hasInformation with LSID of concept as value of rdf:resource
   * use "en" for "nomenclatural language"?


However,  this example uses a deprecated treatment of rank.

[[http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonConcept#TaxonConcept][see wiki page]]

<blockquote>
*Deprecated* The taxonomic rank of this concept as a string. A string representation of the rank of this concept. It is highly recommended that the rank property be used along with this one unless the correct rank is not available in the rank vocabulary. No direct equivalent in TCS but is string version of /DataSet/TaxonConcepts/TaxonConcept/Rank. Requested by data suppliers. After discussions between a number of parties this property is considered to be deprecated. The rank of a TaxonConcept should be indicated by including a TaxonName of the appropriate rank in the hasName property even if the name object is empty apart from the rank.

%GREEN%Yep, you are right. Will fix in next release.  We have to set up an OWL validator to catch stuff like this..... No wait! The <tc:hasInformation> element is empty. If it had content, that would have to be an infoItem. We are just using it as a place to hang the LSID of the taxonConcept.   Terry and I talked about where to hang the LSID and this seemed appropriate. Have to check whether it is still OWL valid....   In general, I want to raise in Fremantle whether there are or should be best practices about where to squirrel LSIDs.-- Main.BobMorris - 01 Oct 2008  %ENDCOLOR%

Regarding Patrick's comment about Bob's comment "Bob was of the idea that biological descriptions are statements of fact and are not intellectual property, therefore they cannot be licensed."  The SPM needs to be capable of capturing the attribution data associated with the content and this attribution data can vary a lot.  We can't just jump to the conclusion that all content is a fact and therefore unattributed.  In science, I might think there is nothing that should be unattributed.  This is different than "copyrighted".  Content can be attributed without being copyrighted.  For instance, there are plenty of authors of public domain content who get attribution.  Can we address this area as "attribution" versus "intellectual property"?  Some content attributions are in fact for copyright, others are not. How can the fact of a "some rights reserved" license like Creative Commons be included with the object? SPM should be capable to include all of the needed data elements to capture the attribution facts of the content.  For the EOL's dataObject in its Transfer Schema, this has led to the use of new "agent" elements with roles of Source, Author, Project, and Publisher, combined with the elements dc:Rights, dcterms:RightsHolder,  dcterms:bibliographicCitation, and dc:source. Also dc:description is used for the actual text content. We need to be able to include attribution facts in the SPM along with the scientific facts.-- Main.ChuckMiller - 01 Oct 2008

I raised the question of how do we cite the descriptions. I see that each spm:SpeciesProfileModel has a spm:aboutTaxon which should ultimately reference a PublicationCitation with publishedIn. I can see that we can clearly cite the source of the taxon concept, but can we always infer that the publishedIn for the taxon is the same source of the description? What if I write a description on my own website, but cite person X's concept of the organism? Either way, it would be great to have a clear statement about the recommended way to infer the proper way to attribution statement for the description. This is also important for EOL and very important for those contributing content of their own.

One thing that I would like to see included is the use of tn:rank in addition to tn:rankString. It is always good as a consumer to get content in the form of a controlled vocabulary rather than trying to reconcile varying rankStrings which mean the same thing.
d375 1
a375 1
Note for Plazi: there are no line breaks in the text in this document. It seems that newlines in the descriptions do not represent line breaks (see #_Description_2_1). Is there some way to include line breaks - either using embedded escaped html or ensuring that newlines represent line breaks?

I have been playing with this latest example a bit more today and have some new questions. The taxonConcepts use tc:hasInformation to point to the resource which describe the taxonConcept, but according to the standard tx:hasInformation should point to an infoItem, not a taxonConcept. So, is this invalid at this point?
a403 1
I also have a bit of a naive question, but one I would like to understand. SpeciesProfileModel contains two main elements which are of class taxonConcept and infoItem. The SPM element I suppose binds these two elements. But, if taxonConcept contains a hasInformation element, which is also an infoItem - couldn't we just have one RDF document which contains a bunch of taxonConcepts which have zero to many infoItems? In this latest example there are several SPM elements which only contain an aboutTaxon and it seems a bit unnecessary to have this extra SPM wrapper. I would be just as happy having a bunch of taxonConcepts, some of which contain infoItems.

---+++ TaxonConcept - accordingToString property: 18 Sep 2008

Why can't you use the accordingToString property for TaxonConcept to solve this problem? Like this

-- Main.ChuckMiller - 18 Sep 2008

There's nothing wrong with this (well, nothing that isn't also a problem with the part of Terry's 17 Sep proposal. See below). However, it doesn't address the original, somewhat technical, problem Terry raised on Sep 6.  That problem was essentially "How is it assured that the different elements of a !SpeciesProfileModel object all refer to the same taxon concept in the face of the fact that rdf:ID values must be unique in the document?" Terry's s proposed solution on Sep 17 is that rdf:ID not the right mechanism to solve the problem, since it is meant to identify an element in the document, not to identify stuff that the element is talking about. Instead, the appropriate thing to do is add an  rdf:resource attribute and hang the LSID there. I think the main reason this is an issue at all is that an SPM can discuss other taxon concepts besides the one it is about. This use of rdf:resource seems to be the approach of most of the TDWG-based examples on the TDWG lsid resolver proxy service described at http://lsid.tdwg.org/. 

I see these problems remaining:

   * It's unclear to me that the current TDWG ontology definitions even allow for attributes to be hung on a the tc:TaxonConcept in the first place (or on any other defined rdf element for that matter...).  I wonder if this means that while the proposed SPM is valid RDF, it may not be valid OWL.
   * What semantics is imposed on rdf:resource whose value is the lsid of  a tc:TaxonConcept that would insure that relevant string data in the resolved !TaxonConcept is in any way related (preferably is the same as) the string data offered in the document.  Unless the document string data were generated by _resolving_ the lsid (and maybe even then if the TC object is returned in the lsid metadata and not its data)  there can be no such guarantee. Indeed, the Hymenoptera Name Server lsids return everything in the metadata. The lsid might resolve to something that is not even meaningfully the same as the one described by the string data.  I raised that problem when the original Sep 6 issue was raised.

---++ Namespace termination
It is pretty important to terminate namespace values with either '/' or '#'.  Although failing to do so is valid  RDF/XML serialization, it can result in ambiguity in the triple form of the RDF, wherein local name is concatenated with namespace to form resource names. Here's a good NamespaceTermination example from Adobe's XMP manual.
