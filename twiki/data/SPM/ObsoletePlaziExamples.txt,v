---+++ New Proposal: 17 Sep 2008

based on reading of RDF Syntax Spec http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar

rdf:id's function is to reify triples and extends base url given in xml:base (which is the uri of the rdf doc?)

using rdf:about to specify that taxon concept LSID is the subject of the SPM

use rdf:resource to specify that the concept LSID is the concept of the about LSID -- not sure about this as it is recursive (A has concept A)?

This at least validates, however.

---++ Deprecation of tc:rankString
---+++ Example of 23 September 2008

Some changes:

   * SPM doc itself is subject of spm:SpeciesProfileModel (via xml:base)
   * no non-referenced namespace declarations
   * an spmi:Description now for each *paragraph* under a tax:Description element
   * spm:aboutTaxon now includes tc:hasInformation with LSID of concept as value of rdf:resource
   * use "en" for "nomenclatural language"?


However,  this example uses a deprecated treatment of rank.

[[http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonConcept#TaxonConcept][see wiki page]]

<blockquote>
*Deprecated* The taxonomic rank of this concept as a string. A string representation of the rank of this concept. It is highly recommended that the rank property be used along with this one unless the correct rank is not available in the rank vocabulary. No direct equivalent in TCS but is string version of /DataSet/TaxonConcepts/TaxonConcept/Rank. Requested by data suppliers. After discussions between a number of parties this property is considered to be deprecated. The rank of a TaxonConcept should be indicated by including a TaxonName of the appropriate rank in the hasName property even if the name object is empty apart from the rank.
</blockquote>

                    three; clypeus large, somewhat flat, carinate and slightly convex on disc, anterior border
                    considerably produced in middle where it is somewhat crenulate, and five large punctures are present
                    along the edge, and smaller punctures, rather wide apart, are scattered over the rest of the
                    surface, posterior border excised in middle; frontal area very faintly defined; frontal carinas
                    rather long, raised, with sharp edges, the rims or edges enclosing the antennal sockets are
                    considerably raised and prominent; a very fine narrow longitudinal ridge takes the place of the
                    frontal furrow and extends between the frontal carinae as far back as their extreme edges; eyes
                    large, broad oval, rather flat, are situated rather high up before the middle of the sides of the
                    head; antenna 12 - jointcd, scape long, thickened at apex, extending beyond the posterior border of
                    head funiculus with all the joints elongate, first slightly shorter than the others, last joint long
                    and pointed. Thorax longer than broad, broadest behind centre of sides of pronotum, somewhat slender
                    behind; pronotum ample. convex, with a short neck, sides margined, considerably widened afterneck,
                    posterior border semicircular; sutures between pro- and mesonotum, and meso- and epinotum fine but
                    distinct; mesonotum longer than broad, shorter than pronotum, somewhat flat on disc, sides rather
                    straight, epinotum longer than mesonotum, sides rather straight, angle between dorsal surface and
                    declivity not marked, dorsal surface longer than declivity. Scale of petiole rather thick at base,
                    anterior surface slightly convex, posterior surface slightly concave, upper surface narrow and
                    forming a rather sharp, ridge; gaster oval, not very voluminous, pointed at apex. Legs fairly long;
                    tibiae prismatic. Long. 18 mm.[[ worker ]] Of the same pale colour as the [[ soldier ]]. but only
                    the extreme anterior angle of clypens and cheeks blackish; the mandibles are pale yellow with the
                    teeth red. The sculpture and hairs are similar.Head long, narrow, broader in front than behind,
                    broadest a little in front of sides of head, narrowed, rather sharply behind eyes to base; teeth to
                    mandibles somewhat more slender and sharper, carinae on clypeus a little more pronounced; eyes more
                    prominent. Thorax narrow and slender; pronotum more narrowed to apex. Scale of petiole of similar
                    shape, but a little narrower; gaster and-legs of similar shape. Long. 10 - 12 mm.</spm:hasContent>

                <spm:hasContent> Very like trispinosus but without the two shorter spines on the mesonotum. The
                    sculpture is different, and the species is also a little darker in colour. [[ worker ]]. Head: the
                    sculpture is quite different; the disc is smooth and shining, from the outer part of the smooth
                    surface at sides semicircular carinae run on each side along the cheeks, and from the posterior part
                    a few weaker carinae extend towards base of head, the space between these and the posterior border
                    of head being smooth and shining.Thorax: the ridges on the pronotum are considerably less marked;
                    the mesonotum is smooth and shining and there are no spines present. The ridges on the sides of the
                    thorax are less marked; the dorsal surface and the declivity of the epinotum are smooth and
                    shining.The spines on the pronotum are slightly longer and stronger, and those of the epinotum,
                    being of a different shape, being slightly shorter, and projecting outwards then inwards in an even
                    curve. Long. 5 mm.</spm:hasContent>
