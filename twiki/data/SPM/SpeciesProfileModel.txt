---+ Species Profile Model

---++ Definition

The Species Profile Model is designed to enable an entity to express information about a taxon to a range of different client applications.

This definition implies (to RogerHyam at least):

   1. The data model does not define the entity - the entity already exists and is referenced in some way...
   2. The data model does not define a taxon - the taxon already exists and is referenced in some way...
   3. The information is typed so as to be useful.
   4. The model must either:
      1. restrict the information to a set of defined information types.
      2. be extensible/modular to allow for a range of information types. 
   5. Not all client applications are known to the entity.

---++ Sample Species Instance Documents

These two examples (fish and nematode) are pre-workshop examples made available to get the discussion going and thus differ somewhat from the actual model developed in the workshop (not actually RDF expressed in the ontology)
   * Fish record: http://wiki.gbif.org/dadiwiki/images/speciesmodel/fish-record.xml
   * Nematode record: http://wiki.gbif.org/dadiwiki/images/speciesmodel/nematode-record.xml

See also InstanceExamples for further discussions. 

These kinds of species descriptions begin to overlap with SDD (http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/SDD/WebHome).
