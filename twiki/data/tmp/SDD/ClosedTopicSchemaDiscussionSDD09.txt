This should be structured by Schema sections/subsections. Please insert your discussion topic into the appropriate place.
Discussions should start under "Active topics". If you want to get a vote, please move them to the next column, Proposals. Discussion placed there should be viewed with priority. Please do add your vote if you have an opinion. After discussion, each proposal will be either signed off by participants then changed in the schema and closed, rejected and closed, or discussions will continue.
