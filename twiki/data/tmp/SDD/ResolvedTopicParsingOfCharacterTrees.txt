Consider the following character tree:

<verbatim>
leaves
	 shape
		  ovate
		  elliptic
	 indumentum
		  upper surface
				glabrous
				pubescent
		  lower surface
				glabrous
				pubescent
	 ...etc		  
</verbatim>

We can tell from this tree that "ovate" and "elliptic" are character states
(they have no children), "shape" is a character (it has only states as
children) and "leaves" is a character group (it has only characters or other character groups as
children). 

It's tempting then to say that there's no need to specify a type for each node of the tree, since we can easily parse the tree to work out what type any node is.

However, partially marked up natural language descriptions may
have character trees with no character states:

e.g.

<verbatim>
"<Leaves>Leaves simple, ovate to elliptic, with toothed margins,
undersurface pale, pubescent.</Leaves> <Flowers>Flowers blue.</Flowers>"
</verbatim>

This would require a simple tree:

<verbatim>
Leaves
Flowers
</verbatim>

The simple rules than can be used to deduce the types of nodes in a complete character tree (one in which all branches eventually lead to states) cannot be used to identify the nodes in this partial tree as character group nodes.

So - the types of nodes in character trees will need to specified.

Character trees are subsumed in the object called <nop>CharacterGroup, and nodes are the recursive object called <nop>CharacterGroupItem. The main defect I see in version 0.62 is not that it is difficult to tell what branch is a Character definition in Definitions (resp a <nop>CharacterReference in a Description) ---that is easy because in both <nop>CharacterGroupItem and <nop>CharacterReference character definitions are by keyref only---. Rather, I think the (small) defect is that there are two ways to represent a flat character list either in Terminology or Descriptions, namely as a sequence of <nop>CharacterDefinition objects (resp. <nop>Character keyrefs). The second is inside a <nop>CharacterGroupItem whose tree happens to be of depth two---a root and a bunch of nodes each with a single Character and nothing else).

"defect is that there are two ways to represent a flat character list either in Terminology or Descriptions, namely as a sequence of <nop>CharacterDefinition objects [... or ...] <nop>CharacterGroupItem tree"

This is not correct. The sequence of characters in Terminology/Characters is <em>not</em> informative, it may change without changing the arrangement of the characters. A flat sequence of character can <em>only</em> be defined in character (or now "concept") trees. The character list itself does not define a sequence, it should be considered an unordered set. Unfortunatly, there is no support in schema to express whether a sequence has semantics or not (in RDF we have set, seq, and alt collections!).
