---+++General topics

TypePolymorphismWithXsiType, ConstraintsAndTypeSafety, BestPractices, DebugrefAutomation, QueryLanguages, UBIF.FormattedText 

---+++Missing features
   * ModularizationOfSchema, ExternalTerminology, FederatingDescriptions (still very relevant, the discussion in Berlin did not result in a solution yet)
   * SecondaryClassifiersWithinClasses (aka TheProblemOfSex)
   * NameForStandard, NameForStandardWikiDiscussions
   * OpenDiscussionPointsSDD10 summarizes points from my list of things to do, that I could not address before the release of 1.0

Below is a first attempt to restructure topics according to the modified schema sections, incorporating the common UBIF elements
(everything below <nop>DescriptiveData!)

---+++Discussion of existing features 

An important feature of the UBIF and SDD schemata are enumerated values, see SDD.EnumeratedValues and UBIF.EnumeratedValues. See also UBIF.SemiControlledEnumeratedValues.

This should be structured by Schema sections/subsections. Please insert your discussion topic into the appropriate place.
Discussions should start under "Active topics". If you want to get a vote, please move them to the next column, Proposals. Discussion placed there should be viewed with priority. Please do add your vote if you have an opinion. After discussion, each proposal will be either signed off by participants then changed in the schema and closed, rejected and closed, or discussions will continue.
