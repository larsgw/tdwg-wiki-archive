<h2>Changes in SDD 0.9 beta 23</h2>

<nop>StoredIdentificationKeys/<nop>GuidedKey tentatively renamed Keys/Key
 The difference to multiple entry /interactive keys may as well be 
declared in annotation. Keys really is for <nop>StoredIdentificationKeys that are 
<nop>DesignedKeys, i. e. manually authored, so <nop>StoredIdentificationKeys captures only 
part of the difference. Since it is a non-standard term which I 
invented, it may be better to avoid it in the schema. Please comment 
if you disagree!

Citation and Metadata were missing in the Key and <nop>ConceptTree 
definition, added. Changed the sequence of Metadata and the 
<nop>AnnotationGroup elsewhere to be consistent throughout the schema.
Note: Kevin raised a question whether it is appropriate to have  
Metadata as a separate element. Please refer to Trash.SDDResolvedTopicMetaDataAsTypeOrModelGroup.

After talking with Bob I changed Selector to Selectors, i. e. a 
collection of resources. However, still this is not a list of 
anything that may be relevant, but is a list of multiple images that 
should be displayed together to make a single selection.

If anybody knows a better term than Selector please make a proposal. 
I would like to avoid the ambuiguity of <nop>MediaResource, which may be 
any kind of more or less relevant information. I want concise 
information that can be used instead of the label to make decisions.

Type derivation error in <nop>ReportedNotes, causing it to 
falsely require an audience reference, fixed.

I had put <nop>IsTemplateForChildDescription (intended as a taxon-tree sensitive replacement for implicit values in DELTA) into the dead-wrong place, i. 
e. into the character state definition, rather than into the state 
data (reference used in descriptions).

Multiple minor changes, mostly annotations. Terminology section 
changed to optional. At one place (forgot where ...) element 
cardinality was 1 where really a collection was meant.
