---++++ Separation of Terminology and Description editing

How much Terminology should be editable on the fly?

If we really want to limit some authors's right on editing teminology, how about we introduce the Role concept into the editor.

---++++ Objects in Descriptions should be offered only where they can actually be used.

For example, a State not associated with a given Character should not be offered as a choice for coding that character

---++++ The id/ref mechanism should be hidden from the user, but enforced.

Users should always get their choices offered by label text, not by id values

---++++ <nop>NaturalLanguage and <nop>CodedDescriptions should both be supported

---++++ Editor engine interfaces 

The editor engine should be able to be used with many kinds of software, such as editors of other objects (e.g. image content metadata), web services, etc. 

---++++ Template support
