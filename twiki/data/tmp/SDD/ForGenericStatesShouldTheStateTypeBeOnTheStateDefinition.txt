We have made three generic states Transparent, Translucent, and Opaque which we use in characters with names like <nop>HindWingDensity. We have to express that these characters or <nop>__ordinal-discrete on the character itself, when in fact it might make more sense to express that in the generic state definition. As it is, someone could refer to those states in a character of type, say, numeric,  which would not be very sensible.

A separate(?) question is: for a an __ordinal-discrete character, whether local or generic, is the order determined in some enforceable way? Does this belong in the character or the generic state def? One character use may prefer them in a different order from another, but still have all the same semantics for the actual states.
