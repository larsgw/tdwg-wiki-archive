|<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Rel24.GIF" alt="Rel24.GIF"  >|This is the history of the sdd repository at the state of the release of SDD1.1-RC1.<br/><br/>Red boxes are branches that have been removed. (In SVN, you can run but you can't hide.). <br><br>\
SVN branching occurs only when a new branch is made, so in this view, intermediate revisions exist that did not cause a branch. These may still participate in the construction of a branch though. For example, Revision 24 is the final revision of /releases/SDD1.1-RC, but it contains a file modified in Revision 22. It is the intention to never have more than one branch of a given released version: anything else would (and did) represent an error in the release process, including the existence of the releases named foo2. So I deleted the erroneous releases. Thus, the graph itself gives no insight into which revisions of the trunk participated in the release. However, the SDD release process creates a !ReleaseNotes file distributed with the release (but not kept in the repository) which tells the latest revision of the tree having modified files that participated in the release. <br><br>\
Because _any_ change that happens in the repository causes a new revision, there may be files not participating in a particular branch, e.g. something in releases/. <br><br>\
Explicitly creating a new branch, as is our policy when a new release is made, also creates a new revision. So a release will _always_ have a higher revision than any file participating in it. |
