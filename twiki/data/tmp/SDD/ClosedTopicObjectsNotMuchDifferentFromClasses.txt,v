It's no surprise that Object and Class consist of mostly a common thing with only a few small differences. In OOP languages this usually manifests itself by the fact that there is a Class Class, so that a Class is itself an object of something. The stuff that describes Class Class is thus exactly what is common to all Classes. 

SDD could probably be simplified if the commonality in Class and Object that occurs in 0.9 is typed and given a name, and both Class and Object are derived types from that. _UrClass_ might be a good name.

I have a problem to follow, it seems this is the answer to a discussion, rather than the start? I do not see any communality in SDD 0.9 between <nop>ClassNameConnectorType and <nop>DescribedObjectConnectorType, other than the one already inherited from the - much more general - <nop>ResourceConnectorBaseType.

Can you clarify this discussion?
