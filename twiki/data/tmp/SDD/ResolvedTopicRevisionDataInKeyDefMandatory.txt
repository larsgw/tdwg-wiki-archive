I noticed that the <nop>RevisionData/Label elements in <nop>DesignedKeyNodeType are Mandatory. 
We are in the process of transforming an application into SDD and i am not sure if we
want to include <nop>RevisionData information on all of the nodes.

(I think you are referring to <nop>DesignedKeyDefType (= an entire key) rather than <nop>DesignedKeyNodeType.) Good point, the <nop>RevisionData information should become optional here as well (in version 0.91 this has already tentatively done). It is highly recommendable to document who authored the scientific information in the key, and when the key was digitized and updated, but it should not hinder conversion - especially so since Identification Keys are largely intended for legacy data!
