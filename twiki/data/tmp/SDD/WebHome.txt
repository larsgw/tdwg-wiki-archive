Welcome to the home of the <strong>SDD WIKI</strong>! This is a web-based collaboration area for discussions of the subgroup on the Structure of Descriptive Data of the [[http://www.tdwg.org][Taxonomic Data Working Group]]. We welcome your contributions - please see the bottom of this page if you are new to this Wiki.

---+++ [[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/SDD/Primer/WebHome][Primer draft available!]] 
The Primer is based on [[Version1dot1][version 1.1, RC1]]. There are consequential technical differences from the current [[DiscussionFor1dot1RC2][RC2]] but few should affect the Primer. It is expected that 1.1RC3 will be released before December 31 2006 with very few changes from RC2, and that a stable release made shortly thereafter. ... -- Main.BobMorris - 26 Oct 2006

---+++Starter Topics
   * As part of the TDWG Infrastructure Project we have developed a [[Charter]]. Please comment!
   * After the vote on SDD 1.0 at St. Petersburg several minor problems have arisen. We have addressed these by providing a slightly modified version of SDD and recommend that all usage of SDD should refer to this [[Version1dot1][version 1.1]].
