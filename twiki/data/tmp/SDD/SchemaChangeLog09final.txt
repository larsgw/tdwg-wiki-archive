<h2>Changes in SDD 0.9 (final release 1. December 2003)</h2>

A few changes occured between the last beta version (beta 29, see SchemaChangeLog09beta29) and the final release:

Kevin critized the <nop>GeneratorMetadata. We only need an unspecific Generator self-description element, not copyright and authors. The additional element is required to keep the Name and Version clean. Changes: Changed Application/<nop>ApplicationVersion/<nop>ApplicationCopyright to <nop>GeneratorName/<nop>GeneratorVersion/<nop>GeneratorNotes. Removed <nop>ApplicationAuthors. 

<nop>ConceptTrees: Changed Concepts (container with a collection of Concept elements) to Nodes.

<nop>ClassHierarchy trees: added container for Node, container is called Nodes.

Keys: Changed Leads to Nodes, changed  position of this in Keys, so now a pure collection container (the question text used to be inside in previous versions).

The final version is available at: http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-SDD/Minutes/2003Lisbon_schema/SDD_09.xsd
