   1. 2008_09_27_Lee Belbin. Hilmar Lapp in OJS cannot see abstracts in his session even though he is a Section Editor. The other Section Editor (Nico Celinese) can see the abstracts. I've removed Hilmarr from the Section and re-added him, removed Nico and re-added, checked Hilmar's profile (e.g. duplicate?) but to no avail.
   1. 2008_10_03_Wouter Addink. Adding a record to the Biodiversity Database: "I have to say that it was a little more difficult than expected, because the first time I was already logged out when I clicked on submit (so I had to start over). Also it tells that you can upload a logo in jpg, png or gif but I was only able to submit a gif because it did not accept jpg or png mimetype (image/pjpeg or image/x-png). It was also somewhat difficult to enter the start date: 01-01-2008 was changed into 01-Jul-2006. It did accept a date in the format 01-Jan-2008 though."
   1. 2008_10_06_Lee Belbin. Trying to upload an abstract to OJS logged in as Jim Croft/Author. Couldn't upload any version of his abstract. Wen back to look at Users and when I clicked on Authors, got the following error "DB Error: Got error 28 from storage engine". Clicking on any role in OJS results in the same error.
   1. 2008_10_20_Lee Belbin. Started to upload PowerPoint presentations in Fremantle but could not upload anything bigger than about 8mb. Seems there maybe a parameter controlling the maximum file size of the upload. The error was either lost connection or similar. I emailed Ricardo and he fiddled and the problem has gone but we don't know what it was or how to fix it. I've sent another email to Ricardo to tell him it appear ok and to let me know what the issue was so we can deal with it in the future. As of December 16 2008, this problem remains. Where is the TYPO3 parameter? (PH add: I think it's in the fileupload plugin; under Typo3 look at EXT manager, fileupload, there are config php files like ext_emconf.php listed which might have them in there? check typo3conf/ext/ folder).
   1. 2008_11_01_Lee Belbin. We need to send out renewal notices but first need to import the memberships from TDWG 2008 via RegOnline. There is a page on TYPO3 http://www.tdwg.org/membership/management/import-from-regonline/ that imports a RegOnline export to the user database I assume. There is a a Dry Run button which is nice. There is a RegOnline 'report' called 'Ricardo_FullProfileForDatabase' that produces a list of regered user details that contains memberships etc. I exported this to Excel and CSV but when I tried the Dry Run, both files produced an error "The filename /tmp/phpGTBUKE is not readable".
   1. 2008_12_16_Piers Higgs.  Changing the executive lists.  I think we need to change three things after discussions with Lee; http://www.tdwg.org/about-tdwg/executive/ as the HTML page, The back end mySQL database (fe_users/fe_groups tables) and the mail aliases on the OWL box under owl:/etc/postfix/virtual.  Not sure though... I have access to mySQL through the phpmyadmin implementation under typo3, and I think I have root login for OWL. Lee: There is also a setup to send notifications in OJS Charters to the exec for review - so I am unsure where OJS is getting this list from - hopefully somewhere central! Addition(PH): Done in Mailman and documented using the owl bit.
   1. 2008_12_16_Lee Belbin. There has been discussion about combining Mailman lists. TAG+GUID+TAPIR, a general tdwg list (remains as is) and possibly all other groups into TDWG_content. How do we best combine lists? There is no merge command. We could create new lists and somehow deprecate the older ones leaving the archives as is.
   1. 2008_12_18_Lee Belbin. We have three new Task Groups and I have little idea of the steps that are needed to setup the resource pages for them in TYPO3, Twiki, Mailman. They need a home page and layout that suits their needs. I can probably setup a Wiki and we have some instructions for setting up a new mailing list (but admin pw required). How is the charter published? What does that mean or imply? How do we display the group's charter on the groups home page?
   1. 2008_12_18_Lee Belbin. A few weeks ago, NCD was accepted by the exec for public review in OJS but I can't now 'publish' NCD to retired, prior, current or '2005'. Helen Thomson's suggested a simplified classification of standards that Donald has agreed to. I contacted Ricardo to ask how we could change the structure in Standards which would need to flow through to OJS. He asked me to write text on the new classification and I've sent this to him. So, how do we change the 'journal' (=standard) in OJS?  
   1. 2009_01_30_Lee Belbin. This is not new but added here for completeness. What are TDWG systems and what applications run on what systems?
   1. 2009_01_30_Lee Belbin. Again, an oldie - what applications do we *really* need to update/upgrade?
   1. 2009_01_30_Lee Belbin. Are there any *effective* all-in-one apps that could significantly reduce our systems maintenance?
   1. 2009_02_02_Lee Belbin. People have been adding Comments to the NEWS ITEM on the NCD Public Review and the Standards Page on NCD as well as using the Comment facility in OJS for published items. So, how do we delete Comments submitted to TYPO3? They appear to be database records. It also looks like Ricardo may have set something up to automatically take info from the published draft standards (for public review in our case) in OJS and creating a standards page for them. We also need to check the code for this to ensure that we are saying the correct things on the standards page when a draft is in public review.
   1. 2009_02_02_Lee Belbin. Another oldie: Can we setup a duplicated test system?
   1. 2009_02_23_Lee Belbin. OJS: Gail just noticed that the REGISTER links on the home page of OJS go to www.tdwg.gbif.org/membership! I've had a look around as Journal manager but cannot see how to edit these links. I emailed Ricardo about it and await a response. 
   1. 2009_03_04_Piers: OJS: I tried to enroll a new reviewer who was not a member when setting up the TAPIR review.  It let me put in details of the person (not registered in TDWG) but at the end of that step it just stopped and presented me with a blank page and a "Done" message, and nothing had happened.
   1. 2009_03_04_Piers: Wiki: via Lee, there is a wiki problem for the ProgramCommittee wiki, where the two "Edit" links on the top and bottom of the page don't both work as expected; the top one works, the bottom one gives an error "Access check on Conferences.Tdwg2009 failed. Action "change": access not allowed on web."
   1. 2010_08_07_Piers: Wiki, via Lee, there is an issue with the search box not showing in Chrome.  See the screenshot below (Chrome on top, Firefox below): 
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/searchbox.JPG" alt="searchbox.JPG" width='617' height='209' />
   1. 2010_08_12_Stan Blum: Account management.  Request to email password accepted, but user does not receive an email.  Reported by Tom Orrell; confirmed by Stan:  enter valid username, with bad password, get to the login failed page; request system to send password; enter email address, press send; system behaves as if it the email was sent, but no email received.  Could be a larger problem with sending email from this system.

---+Solved Problems

   1. 2008_10_09_Lee Belbin.  Wanted to set up a new mailing list, but I am not an administrator of the Mailman application. Ricardo responded 10_9 and Lee added the steps to the mailman doc area
   1. 2008_12_17_Lee Belbin. Kevin Richards pointed out the links to the GUID Wiki on teh GUID hom epage went to the old GBIF GUID WIki. I was able to change the links on the RHS (that changed the navigation bar link) but was not able to figure out how to edit the Wiki link in the Activities table on http://www.tdwg.org/activities/. This is a plug in that Ricardo made but I can't see how to edit the data. (PH add: I dug around in the mySQL database, there is a table fe_groups which has this as a column, I altered the values in there and the activities table updated.  Lee did the other ones on the other pages.)  See also: http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TDWG_Systems/TDWGTypo3Documentation
   1. 2009_01_20_Piers_Higgs.  Darn it, how on earth do we add people to the TWikiAdminGroup wiki group?  It's been a long day and I need "click here, click there" instructions... done a quick documentation up about it after mucking about for far too long.
   1. 2009_02_16_Piers Higgs: Reed wasn't in the exec list, so I added him after he asked about it via Lee.
   1. 2009_02_25_Piers Higgs: Lee's secretariat@tdwg.org email alias.  Set up today via the documentation in the wiki
   1. 2009_03_04_Piers: Troubleshot Lee's Conferences wiki settings.  Realised the # is the comments sign!  Also put in a bit more documentation about deleting pages and attachments to the wiki management documentation.
   1. 2009_03_09_Piers: added pc@tdwg.org to the mail aliases as per Lee's request for a program committee group.  
   1. 2009_03_22_Tim: I need access to SVN.  Ricardo provided it, along with a quick how to, which was added to the wiki.
   1. 2009_03_25_Piers: amended a user's login that seemed to get screwed up when being created (he sent a password reset before approval was fully finished maybe?) and then had to manually change his front and back end passwords in typo3.  Added to the wiki as well
   1. 2009_05_05_Piers: Added Charles Kahindo (ckahindo@africamuseum.be) and Helmut Knuepffer (knupffer@ipk-gatersleben.de) to the pc@tdwg.org email alias
   1. 2009_05_11_Piers: Added the loc@tdwg.org email alias with the local organising committee members in it.
   1. 2009_05_13_Piers: CHanged Charles Kahindo's email address in the pc@tdwg.org email list.
   1. 2009_07_13_Piers: Fixed up the executive committee list.  Typo3 is very painful - you seem to have to manually go through each Front end user and change them to be included or excluded from the group manually.
   1. 2009_07_13_Piers: SVN: After a request from Bob Morris, Markus is setting up http://rs.tdwg.org/mrtg
   1. 2008_12_05_Gail Kampmeier. I'm on http://wiki.tdwg.org/GUID and the link http://lsid.sf.net/ to the LSID Website (resolves to http://lsids.sourceforge.net/) under LSID Resources is broken. "Cannot find configuration. This file is probably executed from the wrong location."  This link also appears on http://www.tdwg.org/activities/guid/ and likely elsewhere. 
   - Tim Robertson has emailed Ben Szekely from IBM to see if he knows anything about this on 08/02/2009. - Ben replies that this was setup by Ricardo.  Tim has mailed Ricardo asking for a pointer on 09/02/2008
   - Piers has manually edited the links to point to http://sourceforge.net/projects/lsid/.
   1. 2009_09_14_Piers: Made a few changes to the mailing lists for the conference and the executive
