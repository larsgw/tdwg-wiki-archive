---++Historical Plan

   * Spend 2009 limping along with help from the volunteer community on the existing site
   * Continue to document any help and fixes we figure out
   * Scope out the new TDWG site requirements (e.g. can we stick with the same Wiki implementation?)
   * Begin development of the new site (on one of the other boxes TDWG has access to (we think we have 4)
   * Aim to launch the new TDWG site at the end of 2009

I didn't say it was very detailed...

---++New Plan

Three options exist:

   * Business as usual (with all the problems)
   * Get someone to update the existing site with no changes 
   * Redevelop and simplify the site

The third was seen as a good possibility.  In order to do this, we need to consider...

   * How systems at TDWG will be maintained in the future (paid or volunteer - likely the latter)
   * The dependencies in the current systems (Lee to help determine)
   * What options are out there for the redevelopment? 

The outcome was to pay someone to look at the options and to evaluate this. Then a second injection of resources may be required to move to a new regime.
