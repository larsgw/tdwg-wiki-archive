This is a listing of what do to in particular situations with the TDWG systems.

---++++DNS Down
The Domain Name Server (DNS) has gone down in the recent past due to 0% free errors.  This has been caused by Ricardo's daily backup routines, which have now been switched off as the GBIF ones are more comprehensive, with the exception of the database backup (which "extracts the database data in a consistent state so it can be later stored on GBIF's backup later").

_Ricardo's Cure_

The trick is really just to free up disk space by deleting unused files (usually logs and temporary backup files).  The best place to look for files to delete is /var/www/backup/data. Since most (if not all) of that data is backed up by Cip and Andrei in another more efficient way, usually any sysadmin can come in and delete files that are more than a few days old.  That's all there is to know about it.
