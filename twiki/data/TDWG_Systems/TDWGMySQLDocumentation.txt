---++How can I access mySQL directly?

Make sure the user is set up to acces Typo3 (http://www.tdwg.org/typo3).  To do that, check out the wiki at [[TDWG Typo3 Documentation]].  

Go to Typo3 and log in using your single sign on, you should see phpMyAdmin down the left hand side.

If you click on that, you're straight into phpMyAdmin.  It will load within the typo3 frame, but it is pretty much a standalone application.  It's official documentation is in http://www.tdwg.org/typo3conf/ext/phpmyadmin/modsub/phpMyAdmin-2.6.4-pl3/Documentation.html but that's not much use... this is a better place to start if you need it: http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/docs.php

Ask the gang for any assistance you might need.
