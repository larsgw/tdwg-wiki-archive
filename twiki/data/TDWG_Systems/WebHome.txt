This area has been set aside for collaboration of the TDWG web and systems administrators.  It will act as a repository of a range of information on the systems in place at TDWG. The *most* important aspect of this Wiki is the *documentation!* Please take a look at the problems that have been identified and see if you can solve them. If you can, please document the solutions on the appropriate page below and move the problem to the solved area. 

---++ %MAKETEXT{"General Information"}%

This section is an attempt at describing the processes about how things are done and can be done.

   * [[TDWG System Contacts]] - A listing of people involved in the TDWG web sites and systems.
   * Email Aliases - [[TDWG Server Documentation]] - A list of all the email aliases that have been setup *These MUST be checked and amended in January each year!*
   * *Email error*: For the past 6 months, the systems have not been able to send email notifications (TYPO3, OJS) and we have just found that this was due to port 25 OUTBOUND being blocked. Cip has just fixed this and we now get registration notifications, forgotten passowrd notifications, OJS notifications!
