This page details a range of things that might need to be done under the TWiki implementation.

---+++Setting up a new group Wiki
   * Add the new Twiki web (http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/ManagingWebs)
   * Edit the tables on the home (http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome) page to add in the new topic to either subgroup wikis, administrative wikis or other wikis - please maintain the alphabetical or priority listing order.
   * Edit the page http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/SubgroupWebLeftBarWebList to add in the new wiki using the same format as the ones currently in the list

---+++Setting up a new Restricted Wiki (like this one)

   1. From the wiki home (http://wiki.tdwg.org/) go to TWiki Web (Admin Web) and then ManagingWebs (half-way down on the left-hand menu). The direct link is http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/ManagingWebs
   1. Follow the link to "Add the new web", enter the details and click "Create new web". You need to be logged in to do that (only admins can do it)
   1. Go to the newly created web and click "Preferences". Edit it to forbid access to others than the members of the TWiki.AdminGroup (to use these preferences, remove the # at the front of the setting).  You need to set the following preferences:
   * Set ALLOWWEBVIEW = TWikiAdminGroup 
   * Set ALLOWWEBCHANGE = TWikiAdminGroup 
   1. Users or groups allowed to change or rename this WebPreferences topic: (e.g., TWikiAdminGroup) 
   * Set ALLOWTOPICRENAME = TWikiAdminGroup

Examples of such wikis are (requires login):

http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/ExecInternal/WebHome
http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/E_Biosphere09Internal/WebHome
http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TDWG_2006_Proposal/WebHome

---+++Adding a new Exec sub-Wiki - a basic add (for Adrian: 2009_01_10_Lee)
   1. Log into the Wiki site
   1. Go to the Executive Committee page. At the top, there are a few topics including TDWG 2008.
   1. Click Edit in the top right corner
   1. Select &#8220;   * [[TDWG2008 Discussion Page]]&#8221; and copy.
   1. Paste the copy under the selected line
   1. Edit 2008 to 2009.
   1. Press Save at the bottom
   1. This creates a new Wiki word identified with a question mark at the end of the line. Click on the question mark.
   1. This creates a new Wiki page, so edit it as required. I&#8217;ve just added the title at this time.

---+++Adding a wiki to the home page and LHS navigation bar (2008_10_10_Lee)
If you want to add a (*public*) topic to the home page *and* also add the entry to the LHS side navigation bar, then here are the steps-

   1. Edit the tables on the home (http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome) page to add in the new topic to either subgroup wikis, administrative wikis or other wikis - please maintain the alphabetical or priority listing order.
   1. Edit the page http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/SubgroupWebLeftBarWebList to add in the new wiki using the same format as the ones currently in the list

---++Adding a new group that will have (restricted) access to a Wiki (2009_03_03_Lee)
   1. Put the name of the new group on this page http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/TWikiGroups
   1. Add the names of the people who you want to be able to read and edit the Wiki to be created and Save the page
   1. Go to the Wiki and click on Preferences on the top of the navigation bar
   1. Edit the parameters-
      * #Set ALLOWWEBVIEW = %MAINWEB%.TDWG2009ProgrammeCommitteeGroup or equivalent
      * #Set ALLOWWEBCHANGE = %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup, %MAINWEB%.TDWG2009ProgrammeCommitteeGroup or equivalent

---++Adding someone to a TWiki group (2009_01_20_Piers)

To add someone to the TWikiAdmin group, go here:

http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/TWikiAdminGroup

Edit the page and you should be good to go.

Group lists are here: http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/TWikiGroups

---++Deleting pages and attachments

To delete a page (or topic), go to the page, log in and head to the bottom of the page to the "More Topic Actions" link, and hit that.  When that page opens you can then use the "Delete this topic..." link to remove the topic.  Make sure to choose the appropriate one to remove any links that might exist.

To delete an attachment to a page, click on the "Manage" link next to the document.  About halfway down the page on the right hand side you can see links in the phrase "Move or Delete <filename>" which will let you delete attachments.

For more information on these, see the following TWiki documentation links:

---++Editing teh elft bar of the wiki

To do this, edit the WebLeftbar topic, e.g. http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/GUID/WebLeftBar
