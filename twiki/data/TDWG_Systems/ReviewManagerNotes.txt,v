Once you have accepted the position of Review Manager, it's a bit daunting where to start.  So I've documented what I did as a bit of a diary process, that I will then incorporate back into the Revew Manager Guidelines document being handled by Lee Belbin.

---+++Before Kickoff

   * Read Lee's guidelines document.  It's full of detail, but at a glance, the diagram at the back gives you a good idea of how things will work out.  After reading this I was pretty sure I knew what I was in for, and that's why I accepted it.

---+++Kickoff

   * Firstly, I thought I'd wait until my appointment was announced via the TDWG emailing lists and news items before doing too much.  I figured that this would mean that people will know who I am and why I am contacting them.  It was announced on the 18th February.
   * As soon as the announcements went out, I sent an email to the author, Renato De Giovanni, on the same day just saying I would be doing the review and did he have anyone in mind to review it.  My network is primarily Australian, so I've asked him for anyone else he might like to suggest.  Given that I want to make sure that it's still a fair review, I will also need to ask a few other people for their suggestions.
   * I asked Lee Belbin via email for any suggestions from him personally (he's forwarded me an excerpt from Renato before), straight after the first email.
   * I logged into OJS based on the email sent to me by Lee to have a look at the document being reviewed myself.  In my case, it's a bunch of files that includes a massive HTML page as the main specification for the standard, but also a lot of the technical documents and templates.  The HTML document prints out at 37 pages in 8 point font, so it's not a light read.  Something to start with when I've got some time...

---+++Review starts

   * I've now got three reviewers set up ready to go (strike rate: 5 asked, 3 accepted).  Now I just need to work out how to get started.
 
---+++Reminders

   * I sent a manual reminder to my reviewers, not realising I can do that in OJS
