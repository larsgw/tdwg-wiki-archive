---++ Sysadmin group Skype of 2008/02/02

16:00 (GMT +8) Start

   1. *Keeping Cip and Andrei informed*. Tim and Markus are in an ideal position to ensure that Cip and Andrei know what our plans are. *Action:* Tim agreed to keep them informed.
   1. *Where should we be in ~12 months?* We need to consider what integrated applications may serve our needs before we invest in updating current applications. An integrated application  would be easier to maintain but some loss of functionality could be expected. Tim suggested Open Core (http://www.openplans.org/projects/opencore/project-home).  Stan said that we must have the ability for membership payments (linking to paypal, etc). Membership/user support is currently built into typo3 by Ricardo. *Action:* Lee to investigate the options for a single, integrated system. We need to ensure that we have disaster recovery in place. Can we recreate the current system? We need to move into a maintenance mode for the current system for 2009 and be looking for a more sustainable system after the patching period.  By 2010, we need to have either solved the problems and continue with the system OR find something and be ready to move in 12 months (and get external funding to do the move).
   1. *Who does what?* We have the following apps:
      1. *TYPO3* (probably most complex). Tim agreed to handle Typo3.  Ricardo putting together what he has done in documentation.  *Action:* Tim to follow up with Ricardo about Typo3 documentation.
      1. *OJS* (unsure how much tweaking has gone on &#8211; but this is the next in importance to TYPO3 as we use it a lot - standards, proceedings and charters). We need to review OJS and the code.  No-one has taken on this role as yet.
      1. *Twiki* (fairly easy and not tweaked). Relatively simple and we have the documentation.  Handled by Lee and Piers.
      1. *Mailman* (most stand-alone application). *Action:* Already being handled by Markus.
      1. *Subversion and Ricardo&#8217;s &#8216;glue&#8217; code* (probably the hardest?) and also LSIDs. *Action:* Being handled by Kevin already, and happy to continue. Markus to help Kevin with subversion. 
      1. *Back end databases* (MySQL). Unsure if we should treat these separately. Stan needs access to the users DB to enable us to update membership and get reports out. There is a phpMyAdmin implementation under typo3 which we might be able to grant Stan access to in order to help him generate custom reports.  *Action:* Piers to follow up on getting Stan access to mySQL
   1. *Priority tasks?* The priorities from the sysadmin page http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TDWG_Systems/WebHome are (decreasing order) 15,11,12,9,10,6,8,7,4. We all need to add to the list as they arise and move them to the solved list and documented when addressed. *Action:* We manage change by documenting the Wiki and keeping each other informed of actions.

16:35 (GMT +8) Close

---++ Completed actions

*Action:* Piers to follow up on getting Stan access to mySQL - done.  Checked his Typo3 account, sent an email with details to Stan, documented in the wiki.
