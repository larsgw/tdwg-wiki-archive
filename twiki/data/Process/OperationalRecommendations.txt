---+ Operational Recommendations

Operational recommendations are things that should improve the functioning of TDWG, but do not necessarily warrant specification in the Constitution or Process (Bylaws).  We might consider these recommendations to constitute [[http://biodiv.hyam.net/standards/tdwg_admin_files/standard.xml#a_1.3]["type 3 documentation"]]; not normative or versioned, but still valuable. 

---++ Recommendations concerning the Executive Committee

   * Exec Comm Reviewing responsibilities:
      * Interest and Task Group (TG) Charters for formation of new subgroups; 
      * Modifications of Charters; 
      * Interest and Task Group reports against Chaters every year after the formation of the subgroup; 
      * summaries of expert reviews 
      * Existing standards (annually)

   * All decisions of the Executive Committee should be published on the TDWG web site and announced on the TDWG mailing list; i.e., both pushed to the membership and put in a permanent and well-organized repository. [Lee: we should treat the Executive Committee as if it were a subgroup in that it should have its own web pages]

   * Minutes of any Executive Committee meeting should be published within 30 days, preferably sooner.

   * One meeting of the Executive per year is insufficient if decisions are going to be independent of the annual meeting. Consideration should be given to at least 2-3 conference calls (Skype sessions) during the year.

etc.
