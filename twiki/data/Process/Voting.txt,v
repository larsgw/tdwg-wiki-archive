---+Article 10: Voting

Any voting procedure should afford members sufficient opportunity to vote in an expedient manner and should not impede decision making.

Voting rights are given to individual and institutional (including other legal bodies). Each member is entitled to one vote.

-- Main.LeeBelbin - 04 Jun 2006

The last sentence is not in accordance with Article 8, which speaks of a 2/3 majority and 30 days notice. I suggest to keep this matter under article 8.  Equally, the voting on (electon of) offiers is confined to Article 6. 

So I'd suggest to cut the last sentence of this article (see comment under Article 8). Instead I would add something like:

But for alterations to the constitution (Article 8) and the election of officers (article 6) decisions are taken by a majority of >50% positive votes. 

-- Main.WalterBerendsohn - 05 Jun 2006

In keeping with the change to Article 3 from 'body' to 'entity' and to correct the grammar, I propose that the penultimate sentence be changed to "Voting rights are given to individual and institutional (including other legal) entities."

-- Main.JohnWieczorek - 05 Jul 2006

This article does not state how voting is evaluated. I suggest that para 2 has the following appended: "Voting is decided by a simple majority of votes cast, except where described elsewhere in the constitution" or something to that effect.
