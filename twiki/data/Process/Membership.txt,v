---+Article 3:  Membership

Membership is open to individuals and other legal entities, including institutions, organisations, companies, and government agencies. Membership consists of two classes: 

   a. individual members and 
   a. institutional members (other legal entities). 

Membership is acquired by written notification to the Chair, Secretary, or Treasurer and payment of the current year's membership fee. The Executive committee may choose to waive the membership fee of a member. 

Members are entitled to vote and to receive TDWG publications. 

Membership ends upon written resignation addressed to the Chair, Secretary, or Treasurer or by failure to renew membership by the end of the calendar year following the year of last payment of membership dues.

-- Main.LeeBelbin - 03 Jun 2006

| I changed the wording "legal bodies" to "legal entities".  In US law, entity is the proper term; see  http://www.nolo.com/definition.cfm/Term/1085A11B-68EA-4557-ADF84F11644C2B56/alpha/E/   -- Main.StanleyBlum |

This implicitly excludes organisations and companies from becoming institutional members. Was this intended? Otherwise I would suggest to say:

Membership is open to individuals, institutions, organisations, companies and other legal bodys. Membership consists of two classes, 
   a. individual members, and
   b. institutional members (including other legal bodies).

Furthermore, to aid communications and voting, we should introduce numbered subheadings (see Officers)
