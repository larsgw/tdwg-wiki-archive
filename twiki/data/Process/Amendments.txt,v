---+Article 8:  Amendments

Alterations to the constitution require a majority of votes by both indvidual members and institutional members.  The text of the proposed alteration, and ballots for those members entitled to vote, must be dispatched to the membership at least ninety days before close of voting. 

Alterations to the constitution may be proposed by the Executive committee, or may be submitted in writing to the Executive committee by either at least five members, or at least three institutional members, from at least two different countries. 

By-laws may be adopted, altered, or repealed by a majority of the membership by vote, upon written proposal by the Executive committee dispatched to the membership at least thirty days before the close of voting.

For the new article 10 it was suggested by the project team meeting in Madrid to 
- have a longer time of notice for constitutional changes (90 days)
- instead of a 2/3s majority, to introduce a simple majority decision, but in both classes of membership. 

-- Main.WalterBerendsohn - 05 Jun 2006

It isn't stated how votes on constitutional changes are assessed. According to Walter above, a majority in both classes was proposed. I guess the institutional vote is likely to be less susceptible to entryism, and so the effect would be to discourage controversial changes and safeguard stakeholder interests, while making uncontroversial amendments easier to pass. On that basis I support it.
