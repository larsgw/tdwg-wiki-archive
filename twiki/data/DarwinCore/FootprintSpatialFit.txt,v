---++Element Description
A measure of how well the geometry expressed in the footprint match the original spatial representation, as a ratio of the area of the footprint given to the area of the original spatial representation. Legal values are 0, greater than or equal to 1, or undefined. A value of 1 is an exact match or 100% overlap. A value of 0 should be used if the given georeference does not completely contain the original representation. The FootprintSpatialFit is undefined if the original representation is a point without uncertainty and the given georeference is not that same point (without uncertainty). If both the original and the given georeference are the same point, the FootprintSpatialFit is 1. Detailed explanations with graphical examples can be found in the Guide to Best Practices for Georeferencing (Chapman and Wieczorek, eds. 2006).
