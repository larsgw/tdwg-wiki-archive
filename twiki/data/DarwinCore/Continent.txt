---+++Linking countries to continents
It would be useful to give a link that will determine unambiguously which countries belong to which continent.  Is there a standard (ISO or otherwise) for this?  It would be a rare label that would contain such information in the entomological world at least, and in a paleontological extension, problematic: do you put the continent as it exists today where the "specimen" was found or do you include hypotheses of the state of continents in another era? -- Main.GailKampmeier - 12 Nov 2008
