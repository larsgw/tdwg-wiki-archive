---++Curatorial Extension Concept List

This document contains a list of proposed elements of the Curatorial Extension of the Darwin Core. This schema is incorporated (imported) in the Darwin Record Application schema, which is ready for use with the Tapir protocol.

This is not the normative representation of the draft standard. In the case of any conflict between representations, the protocol-independent [[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/tdwg_dw_curatorial.xsd][Curatorial Extension schema]] takes precedence.

%ICON{bubble}%  *Element Categories*
Posted by: lapham at 2005-09-30   09:42 AM

Currently all elements in this extension are assigned to the Record-level Elements category. The Element categories would probably be more helpful in deternining which !DwC element should receive a particular legacy data element, if the following reassingments were made:

!IdentifiedBy--Taxonomic Elements

!DateIdentified--Taxonomic Elements

!CollectorNumber--Collecting Event Elements

!FieldNumber--Collecting Event Elements

!FeildNotes--Collecting Event Elements

!VerbatimCollectingDate--Locality Elements !VerbatimElevation--Locallty Elements

!VerbatimDepth--Locality Elements

!Preparations--Collecting Event Elements

!TypeStatus--Reference Elements

!GenBankNumber--Reference Elements

!OtherCalaogNumbers--Reference Elements

!RelatedCatalogItems--Reference Elements

!IndividualCount--Collecting Event Elements
------
%ICON{bubble}%  *!VerbatimCoordinates*
Posted by: lapham at 2005-09-30   10:51 AM

The problem with concatenated string fields like this is-- if you want to use the data in them in a batch program, it first has to be parsed out the concatentated string field. The are bacth programs for both UTM and TRS cordinates and a large amvount to legacy data that is not geoferenced in botany. We would be better served by individual elements.
------
%ICON{bubble}%  *!VerbatimDateIdentified -- Text data type*
Posted by: lapham at 2005-10-01   10:51 AM

A place to record date fragments that are incompatible with the !DateTime datatype in !DateIdentifed is needed.
------
%ICON{bubble}%  *!FromAcronym*
Posted by: lapham at 2006-07-12   10:52 AM

This is a proposed new element to indicate the acronym of the iststtution that sent the duplicate to the extent that the data is known. Often the lable will indicate the soruce.

*Note*: The Darwin Core is currently undergoing an review as a TDWG standard.  The pages provide information historical information, but do not reflect the content of the currently proposed standard. The official public review process will begin as soon as the TDWG Executive Committee announces the open public commentary period, which will last at least thirty days. Once ratified, the standard will be published and these pages will be updated. The current proposed standard can be found at

   * 04 Aug 2005 - changed data type from nonNegativeInteger to positiveInteger for !MonthIdentified and !DayIdentified. Changed wording in the descriptions of !MonthIdentified and !DayIdentified to avoid the conception that two digits are required. (Wieczorek, per Ginzbarg).
   * 04 Aug 2005 - changed data type from nonNegativeInteger to positiveInteger for !IndividualCount. (Wieczorek).
   * 04 Aug 2005 - made minor wording changes in the description of !IdentifiedBy (Wieczorek, per Ginzbarg).
   * 11 Sep 2005 - replaced !YearIdentified, !MonthIdentified, and !DayIdentified with !DateIdentified in keeping with similar changes in the Darwin Core with !DateCollected. (Wieczorek).

   * 04 Aug 2005 - changed data type from nonNegativeInteger to positiveInteger for !IndividualCount. (Wieczorek).
   * 04 Aug 2005 - made minor wording changes in the description of !IdentifiedBy (Wieczorek, per Ginzbarg).
   * 11 Sep 2005 - replaced !YearIdentified, !MonthIdentified, and !DayIdentified with !DateIdentified in keeping with similar changes in the Darwin Core with !DateCollected. (Wieczorek).
