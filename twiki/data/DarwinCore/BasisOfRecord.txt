What about seed and other germoplasm collections? Are they <b>PreservedSpecimen</b>, <b>LivingSpecimen</b> or <b>OtherSpecimen</b>? I think these kind of  collections deserve a category of its own -- PacoPando - 1 Jun 2007

Germplasm collections of genetic resources conserved in <i>ex situ</i> genebanks would be <b>LivingSpecimens</b>. These "specimen" are usually called <i>accessions</i> inside this thematic community and are of high economic value, but could still be classified adequately as <b>LivingSpecimens</b>...? -- DagEndresen - 01 Jun 2007

As a user I much prefer to be able to tell apart living animals and plants from seeds and other germplasm collections; if multimedia records are separate in three categories, I do not see why  germplasm collections cannot be separated. Besides, in previous -simple- versions of DwC this was one of the valid concepts -- PacoPando - 1 Jun 2007
