---++Element Description: Catalog Number
The alphanumeric value identifying a record within the collection. It is highly recommended that each record be uniquely identified within a collection by this value. It is also recommended that each record be uniquely identified in a global context by the combination of <noautolink> *InstitutionCode*, *CollectionCode* and *CatalogNumber* </noautolink>.

%ICON{bubble}% *CollectionNumber and Date Ranges*

Dear Rich,

Thanks for your comments. Collection Number was in an earlier version of the !DarwinCore2, but we are now considering moving it to an extension that is particularly relevant to museum collections.  If !CollectionNumber turns out to be commonly used in either Culture/living collections and/or observational data sets (observations of organisms in the wild, as in monitoring data), then we will add it back into the core.

If you all are discussing an extension for herbarium specimens, please note that this herbarium extension would be added on to the "curatorial" extension that John Wieczorek is proposing (the name of this is still to be decided). In other words, the herbarium extension would inherit
elements from both !DarwinCore2 and the Curatorial schemas.

Looking forward to your response  Cheers, -Stan

I would change
!CatalogNumber - "... It is also recommended that each record is universally uniquely identified by the combination of !InstitutionCode, !CollectionCode and !CatalogNumber."

to

!CatalogNumber - "... It is also recommended that each record is [change universally to globally] uniquely identified [add: within your discipline] by the combination of !InstitutionCode, !CollectionCode and !CatalogNumber."

If we use our acronym, UNA, as the !InstitutionCode it will be globally unique among herbaria since it is registered with Index Herbariorum. I can't promise you that there isn't a fish collection in China with the same acronym.

If there were a global index that assigned unique acronyms to the indices like Index Herbariorum, another element could be added, !RegisteringIndexCode. With this element added, each record would be universally uniquely identified by the combination !RegisteringIndexCode IH

!InstitutionCode UNA

!CollectionCode UNA

!CatalogNumber UNA00012345

The !RegisteringIndexCode would also need to part of the !GlobalUniqueIdentifier.

There may be a better way to come up with globally unique identifiers. I don't know.
