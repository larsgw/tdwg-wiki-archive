Geospatial Element Definitions v1.4 (2005-08-04, current)

A table containing the definitions of the elements of the geospatial data extension to the Darwin Core 2.

Description:  This document is an easy-to-read (html) representation of the Geospatial extension of the Darwin Core 2 version 1.4. This schema and documentation are not yet recommended for implementation. (See remarks on the home page concerning versions of the Darwin Core 2 currently in use.)

This is not the normative representation of the draft standard. In the case of any conflict between the two representations, definitions and values in XML schema take precedence.

Status:
    * Ready for review, June 30, 2005.
    * Not for implementation.
    * The discussion is on-going and this documentation will continue to be updated to reflect the evolving consensus.

Submitted by:
!BioGeomancer Collaboration

Submission Date:
30 Jun 2005

Change log:

   * 02 Aug 2005 - wording changes in descriptions for !DecimalLatitude, !DecimalLongitude, and !CoordinateUncertaintyInMeters (Wieczorek, per Ginzbarg).
   * 03 Sep 2005 - changed !OriginalCoordinateSystem to !VerbatimCoordinateSystem and wording to avoid confusion. (Wieczorek).

|  *Element*  |  *Description*  |  *Can be NULL?*  |  *Type*  |  *Min Value*  |  *Max Value*  |  *Open Discussion*  |
|  |  *Geospatial Elements*  |  |  |  |  |  |
| *DecimalLatitude* | The latitude of the location from which the organism or observation was collected, expressed in decimal degrees. Positive values are North of the Equator, negative values are South of the Equator. | Yes | Double |  -90  |  90  |  |
| *DecimalLongitude* | The longitude of the location from which the organism or observation was collected, expressed in decimal degrees. Positive values are East of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are West of the Greenwich Meridian. | Yes | Double |  -180  |  180  |  |
| *GeodeticDatum* | The geodetic datum to which the latitude and longitude refer. If not known, use "not recorded". This concept should be vocabulary-controlled. | Yes | String |  |  |  |
| *CoordinateUncertaintyInMeters* | The upper limit of the distance (in meters) from the given latitude and longitude describing a circle within which the whole of the described locality lies. Leave the value empty if the uncertainty is unknown, cannot be estimated, or is not applicable (because there are no coordinates). Zero is not a valid value for this element. | Yes | Double |  >0  |  |  |
| *VerbatimCoordinateSystem* | A text representation of the coordinate data (Latitude/ Longitude, UTM, TRS, etc.) from its original source.  Example: "470999 1234300". | Yes | String |  |  |  |
| *GeoreferenceProtocol* | A reference to the methods used for determining the coordinates and uncertainties.  Example: "http://manisnet.org/GeorefGuide.html". | Yes | String |  |  |  |
| *GeoreferenceSources* | A list of maps, gazetteers or other resources used to georeference the locality. The content of this concept is meant to be specific enough to allow anyone in the future to use the same resource to georeference the same locality.  Example: "USGS 1:24000 Florence Montana Quad". | Yes | String |  |  |  |
| *GeoreferenceVerificationStatus* | A categorical description of the extent to which the georeference has been verified to represent the location where the specimen or observation was collected. This element should be vocabulary-controlled.  Examples: "requires verification", "verified by collector", "verified by curator". | Yes | String |  |  |  |
| *GeoreferenceRemarks* | Comments about the spatial description determination, explaining assumptions made in addition or opposition to the those formalized in the method referred to in GeoreferenceProtocol. | Yes | String |  |  |  |
