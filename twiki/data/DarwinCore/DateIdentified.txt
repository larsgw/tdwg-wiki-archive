---++Element Description: Date Identified
The date-time in the Common Era calendar in which the object or observation was identified as being a member of the taxon given in the !ScientificName.


---++++ Change Log:
&#8226; 04 Aug 2005 - changed data type from nonNegativeInteger to positiveInteger for !MonthIdentified and !DayIdentified. Changed wording in the descriptions of !MonthIdentified and !DayIdentified to avoid the conception that two digits are required. ( -- Main.JohnWieczorek, per Ginzbarg).

&#8226; 11 Sep 2005 - replaced !YearIdentified, !MonthIdentified, and !DayIdentified with !DateIdentified in keeping with similar changes in the Darwin Core with !DateCollected. ( -- Main.JohnWieczorek).
