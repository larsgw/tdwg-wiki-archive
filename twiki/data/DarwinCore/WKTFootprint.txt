---++Element Description: FootprintWKT
A Well-Known Text (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) representation of the the shape (footprint, geometry) that defines the location of the occurrence. The same place may have both a point-radius representation (see DecimalLatitude) and a footprint representation, and they may differ from each other for the same occurrence. Example: the one-degree bounding box with opposite corners at (longitude=10, latitude=20) and (longitude=11, latitude=21) would be expressed in well-known text as POLYGON ((10 20, 11 20, 11 21, 10 21, 10 20))
