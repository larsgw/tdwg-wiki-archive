---++Element Description: Maximum Depth in Meters
The maximum or actual depth at which the collection or observation was made. Use positive values for locations below the surface.  Examples: 10 (for a depth of up to 10m). 100 (for a depth between 50m and 100m).


---++++ Change Log:

&#8226;	03 Sep 2005 - reverted to !MinimumElevationInMeters, !MaximumElevationInMeters, !MinimumDepthInMeters, !MaximumDepthInMeters from !ElevationInMeters, !ElevationRangeInMeters, !DepthInMeters, !DepthRangeInMeters because the former can better represent original data, which may have one limit or the other without having both.
