---++ Darwin Core Background and History
Darwin Core was originally a product of [[http://speciesanalyst.net/][The Species Analyst]] Project at the University of Kansas. During 2001-2003, under the [[http://manisnet.org][MaNIS]] Project at UC Berkeley, in collaboration with the University of Kansas Biodiveristy Research Center, and funding from the California Academy of Sciences, the first version of the Darwin Core 2 was developed in tandem with the [[http://digir.net][DiGIR]] protocol and its publicly released provider and portal software. !MaNIS was the first deployment of a distributed database network based on !DiGIR (16 Jun 2002), using version 1.21 (sometimes called the !MaNIS version) of the Darwin Core (see [[DarwinCoreVersions][Darwin Core Versions]]).

------
The !Darwin Core currently under review was first proposed in 2004 as a DRAFT standard of the Taxonomic Databases Working Group. At the 2005 TDWG Meeting a sixty-day period of review and comment ended with the retraction of the Darwin Core 2 from consideration as a standard (see [[http://listserv.nhm.ku.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0509&L=tdwg&F=&S=&P=962][the announcement]] on the TDWG mailing list).  The Darwin Core has entered a new period of development, during which concerns about schema architecture for all TDWG standards are under discussion and development by the [[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TAG/WebHome][TDWG Architecture Group]].

The !DarwinCore 2 was proposed in 2004 as a DRAFT standard of the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (<a href="http://www.tdwg.org">TDWG</a>). It was modified during 2005 [...] At the 2005 TDWG Meeting a sixty-day period of review and comment ended with the retraction of the Darwin Core 2 from consideration as a standard (see [[http://listserv.nhm.ku.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0509&L=tdwg&F=&S=&P=962][the announcement]] on the TDWG mailing list).  The Darwin Core has entered a new period of development to address concerns about schema architecture for all TDWG standards.  PendingIssues are being summarized on this site and via a [[http://circa.gbif.net/Public/irc/tdwg/dwcrev/newsgroups?n=dwcrev][mailing-list/newsgroup]] hosted by [[http://www.gbif.org.][GBIF]]  The contents of both sites are publicly visible, but only registered users can create new content, make comments, or post messages to the list. (Registration is easy and has been imposed only to prevent misuse, not a mechanism to limit real participation).  Unfortunately, the logins are not shared between sites, so separate registrations are required.
