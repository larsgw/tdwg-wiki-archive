---++ Plan for 2006/07

   1. Develop an outreach strategy targeting Institutional Members
   1. Determine appropriate membership structure and fees (this will need approval at TDWG 2007)
   1. Help to develop a brochure that could be used to aid recruitment
   1. Ensure that TDWG has effective tools for promoting its activities
   1. Identify a catchment of institutions or organisations that should be members of TDWG. The GBIF data providers and Neil Thomson's idea of a list of 'natural history organisations' are excellent starting points
   1. Creats a list of "What's in it for me" to join TDWG
   1. Identify any barriers to overcome in attracting members
   1. What advice should be given to the Annual Conference Managers to ensure that new members are well catered for?
   1. How to we share the load of outreach?
   1. Bryan Heidorn, Neil Thomson and I have started to identify how we could encourage student involvement in TDWG (StudentsAndTDWG).  Ideas welcomed.
