---++Tastes of Margaret River - Alex Chapman

---+++Margaret River Forests, Coasts and Wineries - Monday 27th October to Wednesday 29th October

The Margaret River area on the far south-west coast is renowned for its forests, scenic coastline, and world-class wineries. This tour will take in them all, in an ecletic mix of scenery, biodiversity, and gourmet food and wine. 

For a full itinerary, see [[http://secure.kalhaven.com/ERS/Itin/ItinProdBook.aspx?brand=DWH&PRODUCT=300&source=1 this web site]].

The tour will leave Monday morning 27 October and take 3 days (2 nights), with all accommodation, meals, and winery tours included.

*Cost:* $769 (twinshare) or $1019 (single)

*Please note:* the tour will be limited to 30 passengers, so please book early, via the website above.  Make sure to quote the Booking Number 364035, to identify your booking as part of the conference tour. Also ensure you mention any dietary requirements (vegetarian, diabetic, gluten-free) at the same time.


*Things to do*

Apart from sampling some great Australian wines, there are opportunities to see the country and coastline, surfing beaches, bushwalks and wildflowers and some animal encounters.  If we can fill a whole bus we should be able to customise the itinerary to take in some particular features, like the Boyanup Karri forest or perhaps the coastal cave system.
