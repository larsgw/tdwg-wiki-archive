---+++Comments
---++++Boyce Tankersley (email: 9th December 2006)
Perhaps as a group we can create a list of advantages of membership for institutions and individuals that can be reviewed and then used to attract new members? While I believe the staff and members participating in TDWG are donating their time for a good cause, that rationale doesn't usually survive our (GBG) annual budget discussions.

My institution benefits from the work of TDWG at my level (bioinformatics) but how do I get my senior management excited enough to invest at the institutional level? The answer is TDWG has to also offer something that my senior management can get excited about. What excites senior management these days? Access to additional sources of money, name recognition (ability to list the name of our organization along with our logo and perhaps a signature image).

I should clarify the phase "access to additional sources of money" with an example. For the PlantCollections project we stated we would host images of the plants in the living collections of botanic gardens and arboreta on the WWW. Pricing the hardware, software and annual maintenance fees came to $92,000. At the St. Louis meeting I was impressed with the MorphBank presentations and after the meeting followed up by email. To make a long story short, MorphBank has agreed to host our images and we have agreed to link PlantCollections to MorphBank so anyone wanting additional information about the plants could obtain it. Within my institution, $92,000 (that wasn't covered by the budget) is a big deal - maybe big enough to obtain additional funds to participate in TDWG. If we came up with enough other examples of the synergies that TDWG membership provide it could be one component of an institutional marketing strategy.

---++++Lee Belbin (12th December 2006)
Excellent example Boyce! A few more examples like this would be extremely valuable.

---++++Outreach Strategy

   1. Identify a catchment of institutions or organisations that should be members of TDWG. The GBIF data providers and Neil Thomson's idea to build a list of bioinformatics agencies would be excellent starting points
   1. Determine a timeline that would result in maximising the effect of the policy before TDWG 2007
   1. What do we charge nstitutional members? I've suggestd that Institutional Membership should be ~ five times Individual Membership.
   1. Would it be useful to have a range of levels of Institutional Membership? One suggestion from St Louis was to have a 'logo' membership where the institutions logo would be displayed on a TDWG page. Maybe three level 'silver - platinum' but what would  the benefits be? 
   1. List answers to "What's in it for me" to join TDWG
   1. List any hurdles to overcome in attracting Institutional Members (eg operational Interest Groups)
   1. What funds are required for an effective program?
   1. What advice to we give to the Annual Conference Managers to ensure that new members are well catered for?
   1. What level of membership do we aim for by TDWG 2007?

   1. Bryan Heidorn, Neil Thomson and Lee Belbin have started to identify what TDWG could do to encourage student involvement with TDWG. I encourage any of you interested to contribute to StudentsAndTDWG.
   1. Send out reminders to renew membership current and potential members at the start of the year (Patricia)
   1. Allow for donations on the registration/membership site. Maybe a lifetime membership option? Will need to write something for the web about a) why this would be a good thing and b) what donators should expect. Ideas welcomed.
