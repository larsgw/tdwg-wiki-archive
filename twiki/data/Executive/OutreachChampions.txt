Perhaps as a group we can create a list of advantages of membership for institutions and individuals that can be reviewed and then used to attract new members? While I believe the staff and members participating in TDWG are donating their time for a good cause, that rationale doesn't usually survive our (GBG) annual budget discussions.

My institution benefits from the work of TDWG at my level (bioinformatics) but how do I get my senior management excited enough to invest at the institutional level? The answer is TDWG has to also offer something that my senior management can get excited about. What excites senior management these days? Access to additional sources of money, name recognition (ability to list the name of our organization along with our logo and perhaps a signature image).

I should clarify the phase "access to additional sources of money" with an example. For the PlantCollections project we stated we would host images of the plants in the living collections of botanic gardens and arboreta on the WWW. Pricing the hardware, software and annual maintenance fees came to $92,000. At the St. Louis meeting I was impressed with the MorphBank presentations and after the meeting followed up by email. To make a long story short, MorphBank has agreed to host our images and we have agreed to link PlantCollections to MorphBank so anyone wanting additional information about the plants could obtain it. Within my institution, $92,000 (that wasn't covered by the budget) is a big deal - maybe big enough to obtain additional funds to participate in TDWG. If we came up with enough other examples of the synergies that TDWG membership provide it could be one component of an institutional marketing strategy.

Excellent example Boyce! A few more examples like this would be extremely valuable.
