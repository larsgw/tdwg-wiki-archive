   * [[http://www.wotif.com.au/ Wotif]] - Last minute style booking service (useful for testing prices!)
   * [[http://www.ratestogo.com.au Ratestogo]] - Last minute style booking service (useful for testing prices!)
   * [[http://www.fremantle.com/westerley/ Westerley]] - This looks good so I've already booked one place. It seems great value for people wanting to share (Lee)

*3. Details of excursions including dates and costs and maybe what to bring*

Current thoughts on the excursions:

Social Functions during conference time:
   * Icebreaker event - Moores building near the Maritime Museum, drinks and nibbles, from 6pm Sunday night.
   * Evening social event - spotlighting and biodiversity talks - Karrakamia.  Entry and bus costs to get there. Wednesday? night. Kevin Thiele following up.
   * Evening social event - wine tasting on the balcony of the Maritime Museum.  From 6pm Tuesday? evening. Alex Chapman following up.
   * Dinner - Thursday 23rd night - banquet - Esplanade Hotel (see first point in this page).

Excursions after the conference:
   * Swan River/Valley Wine tour (Day trip, Sunday after TDWG).  Details on separate page - [[TDWG_Excursion_Swan]]
   * Margaret River tour - 3 days in the week after TDWG (Mon 27 - Wed 29).  Details on separate page - [[TDWG_Excursion_MargaretRiver]]
   * South West Wildflower Tour - 5 days the week after TDWG (Mon - Fri). Kevin Thiele following up
   * Rottnest Island - will negotiate some form of discount on tickets but leave that open to people to go whenever they like.  Details on separate page - [[TDWG_Excursion_Rotto]]

Other options briefly discussed:
   * Fremantle Historic Prison tour?

_I think it would be wise to limit the number of options so that organization isn't overwhelming and numbers make it cost-effective. For example, I'd suggest one wine tour option (Lee)._

_There are three planned excursions post the conference only (1, 3 and 5 days).  I cleared up the "normal" social functions versus the excursions in the bit above.  Is this still too many? (Piers)_

*4. Venues for group meetings Sunday 19th (waiting on Conveners for time slots) and Wednesday 22nd (3 parallel sessions)*

Not sure if we adequately discussed this but it looks like breakout sessions will be held in Notre Dame university.  Various rooms.

_These are largely done - see program (Lee)_

*5. Entertaining keynote speaker who could tell tall tales about weird WA wildlife and botanists and ecologists and zoologists and....?*

Decision to invite Prof. Lyn Beazley as the Chief Scientist of Western Australia to open the conference.  Kevin Thiele to follow up with Lyn and then ask what sort of briefing material she would need. 

_I also suggest it would be good to have a local invited speaker to talk about local endemicity/biodiversity with some local humour. I know of Norm McKenzie but Kevin had someone in mind as well (Lee)._

_I think it was decided to try to run that sort of thing along with the Karrakamia trip in the evening (Piers)_

*6. Organising Committee*

Current Members

   * Kevin Thiele, Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC), Western Australian Herbarium (WAH)
   * Alex Chapman DEC WAH
   * Fiona Smith, DEC WAH
   * Piers Higgs, Gaia Resources

Invitations will be sent out to expand the committee to include

   * Diana Jones or a representative from the Western Australian Museum
   * Kristina Lemson from Edith Cowan University
   * Possibly Ken Atkins, DEC

Previously asked Fremantle Council, no takers.  Willing to help out, as is Notre Dame University.  Extent of this is likely to just be advice.

*7. Poster Sessions and Demo Sessions*

Posters and demos will likely be held in an upstairs area of the Maritime Museum.  Some sort of arrangement will need to be made to help with the demos for power, projectors, etc.  To be discussed firther down the track.

*8. Internet Access and Internet Presence*

Moved to here... [[TDWG_2008_Internet]]

*9. Sponsorship/exhibitors*

No sponsorship seems to be forthcoming.  Piers Higgs indicated he may wish to exhibit or to at least put some material in satchels, he will put a proposal to TDWG separately.  Sponsorship for "must come" members seems to be a possibility through various individual organisations.

_I'm writing a 1-page sponsorship doc that maybe handy in conjunction with a the new TDWG video (which I hope will be done soon): Lee_

*10. Food and catering*

Fiona Smith following up.  No lunches to be provided, instead vouchers for people to go into Freo for lunch will be offered in the satchels, and also for dinner.  Afternoon tea and morning tea provided in the venue but will be mainly coffee/tea/hot chocolate and some biscuits/etc to keep costs down and sugar levels up.

*11. Conference Satchels*

Some quotes obtained - will need to finalise sponsors before production.@

All being followed up by Piers Higgs

   * [[TDWG_2008_Internet]]

   * Internet Access: No available Internet Access at the venue, so thinking about getting in some Ericcson W25 Fixed Wireless Terminals that piggyback off the Telstra network.  Several of these could be moved around to breakout rooms if required.  Still conerns over plans, speed, costs, etc to be sorted out.  Might be some concern over having too much access - don't want people surfing the net and reading emails in sessions, they should be listening to presenters!
   * Internet Presence: To be further discussed with others when we can work out what access we will have!
