---++ Plan for 2007/08

We have a large number of significant outcomes from the work of the [http://www.tdwg.org/activities/tip/]TDWG Infrastructure Project]. There is already a list of AccomplishmentsToPromote. Also at this address is a list of *potential mechanisms/options* for promoting the work of TDWG. Rich Pyle's ideas with the BBC (CybertaxonomyExemplar) is also something that we should try and mesh and help with, however we can. I do have some funds that could help with the plan, at least till the end of the year.

I think what we need to do is to bring four things together into a plan-

   1. Accomplishments, news and products
   1. Options/strategies for promotion
   1. People
   1. Dates

__Should we try and build up a list of actions that we should promote at one time to maximise the impact?__ What do you all think? If we could get 20-30 tasks listed below, that would be a terrific start. We still also have to think of linking this thrust to Rich's BBC activities (CybertaxonomyExemplar).

---+++Actions (please add!)
   1. Gail Kampmeier: Will post news to ECN
   1. Lee Belbin: Drafted a news item for the GBIF newsletter about the Project outcomes and the conference and sent it to Donald. We could also use it for TDWG news and maybe taxacom and TDWG lists.
   1. Lee Belbin: Proded Donald to draft a brief 'vision for 2008' (fireside chat!) for TDWG. Donald has agreed. We could use this as a theme for promotion?
   1. Lee Belbin: Post TAPIR and LSID videos to [[http://www.youtube.com/][YouTube]], [[http://www.green.tv/][Green TV]] and ? These videos are currently being edited and hopefully will be ready to load to the TDWG Resources page and video sites by 24th October 2007. A key issue is if we should hold off on the release of these videos until we have a concerted promotion exercise. With 22 volunteers, if we can build up a large list of actions, this would constitute a serious promotion.
   1. Lee Belbin: Anna and I have just finished edited the Proceedings of TDWG. This we must actively distribute in the next month or two so that it is current. The [[http://www.tdwg.org/proceedings/issue/view/ISBN%20978-1-930723-71-9][online version]] is now available. I have announced it to the 650+ registered users of TDWG, taxacom, ZooBank and Anna is sending it out to other lists that she can add in here. Anything else we can do?
   1. Peter Desmet/André Heughebaert: Will distribute TDWG-related information to all Belgian biodiversity researchers.

Comment : The suggestion on the Wiki from "Boyce Tankersley" from 2006 to show the benefits of applying TDWG standards and protocols for institutions would indeed be a good approach to have additional members. Beside the more technical presentations at TDWG, I think we can make use of the presentation about projects financed by the EU, NSF or other funding bodies and highlight that the statement to use international recognized standards (ie TDWG) in the field was a plus to get these project financed. Especially, give numbers of additional funds and staff members that the institutions could hirer due to Biodiversity Information related projects.@

While I could announce it on tdwg, taxacom and OJS lists (~>>500 people), is there a better way?
