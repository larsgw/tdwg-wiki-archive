This page is intended to list the things that need to be done around the conference.

---++Local Organising Committee Meetings

   * [[20080910_Meeting]] - Meeting on 10th September, 2008

---++ Registration issues (from Lee)

   * 1. Allocate those who registered for the tutorials (234 currently have opted in to the four tutorials) BETWEEN Sessions 8 and 13. _To be done by the program organisers - yes?_
 
   * 2. Tours/excursions... _Post-conference wildflower tour - all in hand (payments made direct to the tour company). Karakamia evening - cash payments will be taken at registration and on Monday. Will need to have all payments made before Monday lunchtime. I'll need to make a housekeeping announcement about this on Monday morning._ 

   * 3. Printed copy of the Proceedings to the 25 who ordered them (RegOnline). _If Piers can get these delivered to the Herbarium, I'll arrange for them to be packed into the conference bags for those who have ordered them._ _Note from Piers:_ I pick up the abstract file directly from Lee and Anna at the airport on Friday at 12 noon, and then rush back to our office to print them and bind them.  It is unlikely that these will be ready before C.O.B Friday so they will have to be brought to TDWG on Monday and handed out to those people who have ordered them.

   * 4. T-shirts to the 42 people who ordered them (RegOnline). _I'll need to get these organized. We are expecting quite a few to purchase t-shirts (AUS$26) at the meeting as they didn't want it on the RegOnline invoice. *I have these in my office - will put into the bags for those who've purchased. Lee to organise how payments can be made at the registration desk._

   * 5. As Stan and Adrian know, RegOnline can print badges from its database. Did the locals know this? _They do now - in hand_

   * 6. Acknowledgement of sponors (get Session Chairs organized)

---++ Before the Event

   * Who is opening the conference?  *WAS* Lyn Beazley (see [[20080910_Meeting]]) - Now Di Jones from WAM
   * Where is the welcome reception on Sunday night? - Moores Building (see [[20080910_Meeting]])
   * Internet connectivity in Maritime Museum - being handled by Piers Higgs (piers@gaiaresources.com.au)
   * Internet connectivity in Notre Dame - being handled by Alex Chapman
   * Printed abstracts - Gaia Resources has offered to print and bind these copies for those attendees who require them (piers@gaiaresources.com.au)
   * Name tags (including multiple coloured ones for the different days) - handled by Herbarium
   * Poster space - we need to have space to show A0 posters at most (mainly they will be A1 from Lee's experience) - looking at poster boards now - *Posterboards have been ordered, will be delivered to Maritime Museum at 3 pm Sunday afternoon. Kevin and Alex will be there then to set up*.
   * Furniture needs to be ready to move into the Museum (for that which is necessary), including poster boards.  Trestle tables can be borrowed from Museum, but will need tablecloths on them to look "nice", also chairs.  Being looked at.
   * All electrical equipment to be plugged into the Museum power needs to be tagged to Australian Electrical Safety standards - being dealt with and processes for delegates being written up.
   * Coffee and tea facilities in the venue will not be cleaned up by the provider - we will have to get people tasked with doing that cleanup
   * Video of the event needs to be organised and put in place - Dave Primmer from Mixed Media has asked to quote 
   * Videoconferencing testing at both venues - unlikely to go ahead.
   * Deliveries to Maritime Museum - officially there is *no storage space* for the event so all deliveries of gear (eg. poster boards) should be made on the Sunday 19 or Monday 20 October.  Deliveries can be made between 09:30 - 12:00 and 14:30 to 16:00.

_Please note: there are other bookings around the TDWG booking for the Maritime Museum.  We will not have exclusive access to the venue until possibly Sunday, and if a booking comes in then this will be Monday.  This means we cannot store things at the venue over the weekend and will have to move some of them in on the Monday morning._

_Please also note: Piers Higgs will be at the Maritime Museum Wednesday-Friday of the week before TDWG helping to host a meeting for the Museum (Council of the Heads of Australian Faunal Collections), and an associated wine tour on the Saturday.  He can do some minor testing during this time as long as it does not interfere with the running of the meetings.  Also we might be able to store small amounts of equipment in the Kailis Boardroom during this time._

---+++++General Setup

   * Need conference registration table (possible to borrow a Museum one, but will need to get a tablecloth from somewhere, banners, etc nearby).  Also need to be considerate that the Museum is a public venue and we can't just place ourselves down in the foyer obstructing the public.   On Monday registrants need to pick a tutorial session.  Collecting of T-shirts as well, and possibly some purchases of these on the day.  Also we have to take money from people who are paying on the day - to do this, Stan needs a few PCs connected to the Internet and some volunteers to help out with checking people in.  He'll also need some change and a safebox of sorts for storing any cash that comes in.  Stan is not covering money for the excursions, though, so we need to deal with that locally.
   * Need someone to man the desk for most of the days of the conference with names to tick off, payments to process, name tags to hand out, etc.
   * Video-ing of the presentations and subsequent stuff - need to process files, make them available, etc.
