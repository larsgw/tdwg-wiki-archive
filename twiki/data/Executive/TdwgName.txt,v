---++What's in a NAME (for TDWG)?

This is a potted history of attempts to come up with a better name for 'TDWG'. The status is now that we have deferred to Donald Hobern, our esteemed Chairman who suggests that TDWG is historic, memory and quirky.

---+++TDWG Motto

We need to come up with a cute TdwgMotto so please make your suggestions and vote on the current list.

---+++Comments (abstracts: Blame Lee)

| Paul | 24 June 2008| having to make promotional videos that include the terms TDWG, Biodiversity Information Standards and BIS is a nightmare In audience tests communicating what TDWG is is very difficult. If we want TDWG to move beyond the "club" we need to broaden its appeal and make the name reflect what it does. Anything with the words biodiversity, information and standards in it has to be a hell of a lot better than TDWG.|
| Stan | 4th Aug | "international" would be good. |
| Walter | 4th Aug| I would like to see "Biodiversity" (information / data) and "Standards". "Biodiversity Informatics" is excluding a core part of TDWG's community |
| Arthur | 06 Aug | 'Biodiversity Information Standards' sums up exactly what we are and do and is short and pithy. Add Group, WG or Organization|
| Patricia | 7th Aug | Not "group" but "Framework", "infrastructure", "network", "body", "Society", "Association". "Organi(s/z)ation is a problem (and Arthur agrees) |
| Lee | 15 Aug | "BIS network"? www.bisn.net is available |
| Walter | 15 Aug | BISO would be nice, but has 3/4 of a million hits on google and biso.net and biso.org are gone| 
| Arthur | 16th Aug | "Biodiversity Information Standards" is good , and www.bisn.com is available|
| Walter | 16th August| TWDG is an organisation not just a network, but could use a subtitle and like a pronounceable abbreviation|
| Stan | 16th August | Sorry, Lee, but BISN doesn't grab me. The abbreviation/acronym for the name and the URL don't have to match. How about !BiodivInfo.org as a domain name? |
| Pat | 16th August| BIS is good so consider Society, body, Union...|
| Walter | 17th Aug | !BiodivInfo?|
| Reed | 17th Aug | I like !BiodivInfo with maybe BIO as an acronym |
| Arthur | 17th Aug | I like !BiodivInfo domain on the name Biodiversity Information Standards |
| Lee | 17th Aug | International Biodiversity Information Standards (InBIS) ?|
| Walter | 17th Aug | BISNet - Biodiversity Information Standards Organisation with www.BiodivInfo.org (www.tdwg.org) or I would support (following Lee's suggestion): InBIS - International Organisation for Biodiversity Information Standards - www.inbis.org/net |
| Reed | 18th Aug | "Standards" is good but the organis/zation issue remains |
| Pat | 18th Aug | "Organis/zation" remains an issue, and different acronym/name/URL may be confusing |
| Walter | 18th Aug | "Organis/zation" correctly describes what we are but can be left out |
| Arthur | 18th Aug | "I like Organization - as far as I am aware only one major international agency uses 's' - the OECD.  All others use 'z'. Common usage, even in the UK is moving towards the use of 'z'. I am happy with any of the above, using the BiodivInfo.org domain for any of them. |
| Stan | 18th Aug | We should grab !BiodivInfo.org whatever name/acronym we choose.  |
| Pat | 18th Aug | Solution n° 3, InBIS seems appropriate (easy to remember, consistency for Name/acronym and url) and .org is still free |
| Reed | 18th Aug | Added a re-arranged hybrid, BIS International - BiodivInfo.org still works for this (and yes, someone should grab it)  - .org is still free for bisint and bisin |
| Wouter | 25th Aug | It seems that there are no people in favour of keeping "TDWG" as part of the name, something like "TDWG Biodiversity Information Standards"?. If there needs to be a choice between "International" or "Organisation" in the name, I would choose "Organisation", because it is pretty obvious that it is international but less obvious that it is an organisation. Therefore I like "Biodiversity Information Standards Organisation". Acronym suggestion: "B=O" (pronounced as B-IS-O). web domain could be biso.org or b-is-o.org. biso.org is not in use but claimed, so it has to be bought. |
| Wouter | 25th Aug | Playing with acronymes: Biodiversity International Information Standards Organisation: "B2ISO" (might give problems with ISO standards?)|
||||
|Exec meeting| May 2008| Need to decide finally on a name. Donald and Stan would like to stick with TDWG| 

---+++Key Points

   * Clear preference for "information" over "informatics"
   * Clear preference for " ... biodiversity information standards ..."
   * The name and the abbreviation/namespace don't have to match (but neat if they do)

Lee

| PatriciaMergen | 16th August| I support Biodiversity Information Standards. Why not just BIS, avoid network or group, as as far as I understood we are more than that, - avoid "organis/zation" because of the different spelling in UK/US English, - Consider Association, Society, body, Union...|

---+Summary (16th August, 2006)

   * *Biodiversity Information Standards* has general agreement. BIS (www.bis.org) is taken by the 'Bank for International Settlements'.
   * What therefore is the minimal modification to BIS that is available, is concise, and that we can achieve consensus on? 
   * Some have not wanted forum, network, association, organis/zation or group.
   * What about "International BIS' (InBIS)? www.inbis.org is available.

   1. The Executive to distribute suggestions to members for comment till *August 24, 2006*
   1. The Executive to distribute the best options to members to enable (if possible) a vote, or at least an informed discussion at TDWG 2006
   1. The Process subgroup is recommending that all voting is unlinked from the annual meeting. If the issue is not finalised at the meeting, it can be raised anytime.

| John (4th Aug) - 'Working Group' signifies action. |
| Reed (4th Aug) - Like 'working group' or 'group' and 'standards'. |
| Lee (4th Aug) - Any other participants to recruit? |
| Stan (4th Aug) - "international" would be good. |
| Walter (4th Aug) - I would like to see "Biodiversity" (information / data) and "Standards". If "Biodiversity Informatics", than not on its own, because TDWG is about informatics people and content people. Although it may not be correct, the term "Biodiversity informatics" is seen often seen to represent the informatics side (like environmental informatics, bioinformatics) | 
| ArthurChapman (06 Aug) - 'Biodiversity Information Standards' sums up exactly what we are and do and is short and pithy.  Covers informatics as well as contents standards - then just add Group (or Working Group or Organization). Very memorable! |
| PatriciaMergen (7th Aug) - If I understood it right, for "TDWG" there will be a more formal structure with Interest Groups, Taskgroups and/or Working Groups. I would thus be in favor of having a name that distinguishes clearly the whole TDWG "organisation",  "framework", "infrastructure", "network" or "body" from its different "subgroups". Keeping the term "working group" at the higher level may eventually lead to some confusion ? |
| Pat (10th Aug) - I support the idea to use information and not "informatics". It goes in the direction of "Information Society", ICT and so on. It includes as well the content and the associated technologies. If we go for Organi(s/z)ation, I have no preferences for "s" or "z", but it is true that we have to choose officially one or the other. To avoid discussions on this we may also choose another term that has the same spelling in US and UK English like 'body', 'Society', 'Association'... Like "Association for Biodiversity Information Standards, ABIS".|
| Pat (12th Aug) - Had another idea this WE which includes all previously discussed terms and makes a funny acronym (see proposition n° 15)|
| Association sounds more like several organisations getting together. BISO would be nice, but has 3/4 of a million hits on google, with biso.net and biso.org gone. "Biodiversity Information Standards Organisation - TDWG" would help us to keep the domain, but will have us explaining again. BioISO? BiISO? 
WalterBerendsohn - 15 Aug 2006|
| I'm was going to suggest prefixing International to BISO, but on second thought just BioISO has a good ring to it, keeping in mind that most people will forget the full name and only remember the acronym.  Bioiso.org and .net are still available.  Will people assume an afflilation with ISO? ReedBeaman - 15 Aug 2006|
| Pat (15 Aug 2006) Maybe we need to be cautious using the term or acronym close to ISO, there may be some legal issues here. For Association, my idea came from 'IWA' the "International Water Association" of which I am member (http://www.iwahq.org). They have also task and interest groups. Indeed "Association" are several organisations working together on a same goal. IWA has also like TDWG institutional and individual members. Would this be contrary to TDWG objectives ?|
| Arthur (16th August) - I like "Biodiversity Information Standards" and www.bisn.com is available|
| Walter (16th August) - I do think that we are an organisation and not a network, however, this could be settled by a subtitle.  I also like an abbreviation that can be pronounced What about BISNet - The Biodiversity Information Standards Organisation? We can still use www.bisn.org and www.bisn.net and www.bisnet.net (bisnet.org is not free) |
| Stan (16th August) - Sorry, Lee, but BISN (which I presume would be pronounced "bison") doesn't really grab me. Someone already suggested "Biodiversity Information Organization". 'BiodivInfo.org' is not taken.  It doesn't give us a catchy acronym, but it's a good url. We also have all the permutations of international, association, organization, society: ABI, IABI, OBI, IOBI, SBI, SocBI, BiodivIA, BiodIO. In any case, I would strongly caution against making a name change without being sure we have something that is significantly better. |
| Pat (16th August) - I support also Biodiversity Information Standards. For the other term, I would say either - nothing just keep (BIS), - avoid network or group, as as far as I understood we are more than that, - avoid "organis/zation" because of the different spelling in UK/US English, - Consider Association, Society, body, Union...|

   * Forum - a designated space for public expression
   * Group - a sub-set of a culture or of a society (this would be confusing if we go with the recommended 'Interest and Task Groups')
   * Organisation - a formal group of people with one or more shared goals
   * *Network - this can be taken a number of ways, 'social', 'digital' etc and all would be appropriate for us*

   * *Biodiversity Information Standards* seems to have general agreement. BIS (www.bis.org) is taken. We should therefore consider the simplest change that provides a succinct name with available web real estate.

   * "Biodiversity Information Standards Network" (BISN) is simple, accurate and www.bisf.org and www.bisf.net are both availabe.

a50 5
 

---+Summary

'Biodiversity' is used in 12 out of 13 suggestions, 'Informatics' in 7/13, 'Information in 2/13 and 'Standards' (or derivation) in 7/13.

Would the term 'information' age and communicate better than 'informatics'? I think it would. There is little gain from the potential of being perceived as 'geeky' by a significant audience that I'd like to see TDWG reach - the managers. 'Information' they understand, and it does cover our business.

'International' does sound good, but I think it makes the name too long for convenience; we need accurate and concise.

| PatriciaMergen (7th Aug) - If I understood it right, for "TDWG" there will be a more formal structure with Interest Groups, Taskgroups and/or Working Groups. I would thus be in favor of having a name that distinguishes clearly the whole TDWG "organisation",  "framework", "infrastructure", "network" or "body" from its different "subgroups". Keeping the term "working group" at the higher level may eventually lead to some confusion ? |

Research over the past year strongly indicate that TDWG's name is not effective in communicating the relevance or significance of TDWG's work. It is planed to retain the 'TDWG' namespace, but propose a few more accurate options. A small group of 'enthusiasts' have been invited to *brainstorm* a few viable options. The following list summarises the suggestions to date.

| ArthurChapman (06 Aug) - 'Biodiversity Information Standards' sums up exactly what we are and do and is short and pithy.  Covers informatics as well as contents standards - then just add Group (or Working Group or Organization). Very memorable!
