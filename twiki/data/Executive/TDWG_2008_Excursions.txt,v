---+TDWG 2008 Excursions

A range of excursions have been put together for the TDWG 2008 conference, and are listed below.  All prices listed are in Australian Dollars.

*Please indicate if you are interested in any of these when you register for the conference.*

---++Spotlighting at Karakamia - Tuesday 21 (or Wednesday 22 October)

Australia has the world record in small mammal extinctions, largely resulting from the introduction of the rabbit and fox. Western Australia has fared marginally better than some other areas &#8211; a number of species that have become extinct in eastern Australia are merely endangered in WA. These include the numbat, woylie burrowing bettong and Gilbert&#8217;s potoroo

Karakamia ([[http://www.australianwildlife.org/karakamia4.asp web site]]) is a private reserve in the Darling Range near Perth, owned and operated by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. Surrounded by a predator-proof fence, it contains one of the largest and most important populations of woylies, tammar wallabies and bandicoots in Western Australia. An evening spotlight is the best way to see these nocturnal wildlife &#8211; and population densities are so high that sightings at close range can be guaranteed.

We will travel by bus on one or two evenings during the week of the conference. A picnic barbecue dinner will be provided, along with a dinner talk on the animal biodiversity of Western Australia.

*Cost:* $32 inclusive

---++Swan Valley Art, Culture and Wildlife Tour - Sunday 26th October

This tour is a very packed coach day trip, which includes: pick up from Fremantle, a trip up through Kings Park, chocolate tastings, a tour of Caversham wildlife park, wine tasting and a 2 course set menu lunch, a visit to an art gallery with a didgeridoo demonstration and bush tucker tastings, a beer sample and snack basket and finally back to Fremantle!

If you are travelling out of Perth after this please note that the tour will run until about 17:30 - depending on traffic on the return.  Leave yourself plenty of time to deal with the airport!

*Cost:* $95 per person (10-19 people), $90 per person (20-39 people), $85 per person (40+ people)

---++Western Australia&#8217;s Wonderful Wildflowers - Sunday 26th October to Thursday 30th October

The Southwest corner of Western Australia is a world biodiversity hotspot. It has one of the most extraordinary floras in the world, with a large number of endemic species and many spectacular forms. In some ways the closest parallel to the &#8216;kwongan&#8217; (heath) vegetation of Western Australia is the fynbos of South Africa, the two continents sharing a Mediterranean climate and Gondwanan heritage.

October is the height of the wildflower season in the south-west. This fully catered bus trip, operated by a quality wildflower tour operator and with expert guides provided by the Western Australian Herbarium, will visit:
   * Dryandra State Forest, a beautiful wandoo woodland in the wheatbelt, and home of one of the last surviving populations of the extraordinary numbat
   * Albany, a beautiful town on the granitic south coast, surrounded by National Parks and wonderful coastal scenery and vegetation
   * The Stirling Ranges, a biodiversity hotspot within a biodiversity hotspot
   * Walpole, nestled in the magnificent tall, wet karri and tingle forests of the south coast

The tour will leave Sunday morning 26 October and take 5 days (4 nights), with all accommodation, meals and National Park entrance fees included.

*Cost:* $1,325 (twinshare accommodation; single supplement $205 per person)

*Please note:* the tour will be limited to 20 passengers, so please book early

---++Tastes of Margaret River - Forests, Coasts and Wineries - Monday 27th October to Wednesday 29th October

The Margaret River area on the far south-west coast is renowned for its forests, scenic coastline, and world-class wineries. This tour will take in them all, in an ecletic mix of scenery, biodiversity, and gourmet food and wine. For a full itinerary, see [[http://secure.kalhaven.com/ERS/Itin/ItinProdBook.aspx?brand=DWH&PRODUCT=300&source=1 this web site]].

The tour will leave Monday morning 27 October and take 3 days (2 nights), with all accommodation, meals, and winery tours included.

*Cost:* $769 (twinshare) or $1019 (single)

*Please note:* the tour will be limited to 30 passengers, so please book early via the website above.  Make sure to quote the Booking Number 364035, to identify your booking as part of the conference tour.

---++Rottnest Island Day Trips - When you want!

Rottnest Island ([[http://www.rottnestisland.com/en/default.htm web site]]) is a short ferry ride across from Fremantle.  There are departure points right next to the Maritime Museum in Fremantle for two of the main ferry companies, Rottnest Express (C Shed) and Oceanic Cruises (B Shed).  It is not easy to stay on the Island overnight - there is limited accomodation - but the location makes it good for a day trip if you want a day off from the conference, or to go afterwards for a leisurely day.

There are two ferry services to get you to Rottnest with different timetables;

*Rottnest Express* - [[http://www.rottnestexpress.com.au/ferryservice.htm Web site]]

Current prices for an adult departure is $53 for a same-day return from Fremantle.  Ferry timetables are on the web site.

If more than 50 people are interested, the price of the ferry drops to $45.

*Oceanic Cruises* - [[http://www.oceaniccruises.com.au/RottoMain.html Web site]]

Current prices for an adult departure is $51 for a same-day return from Fremantle. Again, ferry timetables are on the web site

If more than 10 people are interested in going with Oceanic Cruises, we can get a 10% discount, if more than 15 people go, we can get a 15% discount.
