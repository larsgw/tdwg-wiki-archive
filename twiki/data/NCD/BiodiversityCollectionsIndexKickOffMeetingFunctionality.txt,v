---+ BCI Functionality

---++ Top Priority
   1 Disambiguation of an acronym.
      1 synchronize with existing data source 
   1 Getting from a DwC institution:collection couplet to a web-service or web-page (not necessarily getting the specimen information but getting something informative).
   1 Standard URI string for web-service access to collections. Allow insertion of DwC catalog number into a query to retrieve basic information.
   1 Resource discovery/survey (populating the database with missing collections)
   1 Prioritizing digitization resource. Comparison between what they say they hold and how much is in GBIF.
   1 Nomenclature types focus.
   1 Taxonomic Scope - down to as fine a granularity as possible i.e. species.

---++ Promotion
   * "Annual Report of the Biodiversity Collections Index" - State of the nation.
   * Statistical reports on ongoing basis.
   * Targeted reports for different purposes.

---++ Resource Discovery
   * Finding a specimen record from an inst/col/cat combination. (beyond scope)
   * Biggest Fish in India
   * Collections containing frozen material.
   * Finding people who can check distribution records in GBIF.
   * All the collections exhibited in 1893 at museum X.
   * Location of all the specimens (materials) from a particular expedition
   * Finding the specimens for which have associated archival materials.
   * Regional portal. Give me a view of where all the material collected from this region is housed.
   * Which collections contain types.
   * Mobilizing collections for a common purpose (raise cash!).
   * Finding publications/use of material from our collection/institution (incl. genbank)
   * Finding webservices associated with a collection.
   * Similar collections
   * Neighboring collections
   * ESCROW?
   * Personal collections.
   * Movement of collections.

---++ Gap Analysis
   * Gap analysis (geographic access) - where do we believe collections should be located but aren't.
   * Gap analysis (geographic scope of collections) - where do we not have material from.
   * Gap analysis (taxonomic scope of collections) - what groups are under represented.
   * Gap analysis (preservation type X taxonomy) 
   * Under studied taxa.
   * Prioritizing digitization resource.

---++ Access to Materials/Data
   * Access - policy to a collection.
   * Access - is there a physical catalog
   * Access - is there a digital catalog
   * Finding fish specimens available for destructive sampling.

---++ Resource Allocation / 
   * Under studied collections i.e. we know they exist but we don't know what is in them.
   * All collections in need of immediate physical curation.
   * All collections in need of digitization,
   * Collections in peril.
   * Collections in a war zone.

---++ Implementation Issues
   * What does this acronym mean?
   * Improve standardization in databases - of collections/institutions.
