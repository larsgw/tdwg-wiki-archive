---+++ ETI NCD Toolkit - Wouter Addink
   * 2007 - ETI developed toolkit (http://145.18.162.52/ncd/manage,  login: "admin" or "user", password: "test")
   * NCD reference implementation for managing NCD compliant collections data targeted at institutions like GBIF nodes 
   * Ready for use but not for import/export
   * Nodit is support (but not production)
   * Two languages are supported (English + optional local language)
   * Two Roles: admin and editor
   * Log in as admin can add Institutions & Collections & People also user management.
   * Development in 2007 at ETI was focused on web services: NLBIF portal, Catalog of Life webservice created
   * Development in 2008 will be focused on community driven portals: Portal Toolkit, Cultivar Finder portal
   * Going to embed toolkit in open source content management / community building tools (Drupal) 
   * Demo of prototype (http://145.18.162.103/ncddrupal, login: "test admin" or "test user", password: "test")
   * NCD toolkit embedded in Drupal can do multi-language and change look and feel.
   * Five Roles: Visitor, Registered User (can add comments), Editor (edit, translate, revisions), Admin (rights for managing content, rights and users),     Superadmin (full access for changing system functions (for developers).
   * No syncro mechanisms yet
   * Would be good basis for BCI.
   * Can upload images etc

   * Evolving requirements for NCD collections 
   
---+++ OBIS - Edward Vanden Berghe
   * Marine species online - biogiographic info
   * As open as possible
   * Integrating data is important - on a large scale
   * Not just big things - protists too

   * IOC, FAO etc
   * Standards: DwC (briefly at ABCD). 
   * MetadataL Global Change Master Directory - NASA
   * MEDI - IODE; FGDC- US GOV

   * DwC added Depth. Begin and end point, Sample size.
   * OBIS 238 data sets 14m records
   * 3 part code plus basis of record
   * 10m are observations
   * 1m are specimens
   * People are confusing three fields.
   * Collaboration to build controlled vocabulary
   * Some useful info available within the system.

---+++ Remote submissions - Roger Hyam
---++++ !CollectionsWeb
   * Hank Bart -Tulane University Museum of Natural History
   * The goal of CollectionsWeb is to improve lines of communication among curators of U.S. natural history collections (NHC), researchers using the collections, other programs dealing with collections issues, and other stakeholders, in order to build a more effective NHC community and increase the base of support for NHC.
   * To accomplish this goal, we are developing a number of web resources, and planning a series of workshops and symposia on important collections-related issues.  All of the products of these activities will be accessible through the project web site, www.CollectionsWeb.org, the portal for communicating and disseminating information about the project.
   * One of the CollectionsWeb workshops (tentatively scheduled for 2009-2010) will focus on databasing and networking and we see good opportunities to collaborate with and learn about best practices from Biodiversity Collections Index (BCI) in this area.
   * Another obvious area of overlap and potential collaboration is the design and implementation of collection information systems.  CollectionsWeb plans to conduct a survey of U.S. NHC.  The purpose of this is to pull together basic information on holdings, curators and other staff, support, research and collection issues.  This effort would benefit from any standard descriptors of NHC developed in connection with BCI.

---++++ Atlas of Living Australia
   * Donald Hobern - CSIRO
   * Australian government-funded science project to develop computing infrastructure for integrating biological knowledge
   * Core data types: specimens/observations, names/taxonomy, molecular, descriptive, multimedia
   * Goal is to maximise discovery and accessibility of biodiversity data
   * Need well-managed reference lists to organise and interpret data records, particularly specimen records
   * Accurate identification of collections is a critical step in locating specimens from references

---++++ !ZooBank
   * Rich Pyle - ICZN/Bishop Museum
   * The Official Online Registry for Zoological Nomenclature.
   * Names are anchored by type specimens.
   * Need a unambiguous way of expressing the location of type specimens.
   * Location needs to be tracked even when collections are moved or merged.

---++++ Insect and Spider Collections of the World
   * Neal Evenhuis - Bishop Museum
   * List of ~2000 collections with abbreviations.
   * Searchable and downloadable on web.
   * Assisting the arthropod community with a set of standard abbreviations to use in communicating depositories.
   * Tracking collections not institutions (some institutions have multiple collections).
   * Currently no cross checking with other zoological or botanical lists for use of the same abbreviation.
   * Personal/temporary collections don't warrant ISCW abbreviations - must be 'permanent'.
