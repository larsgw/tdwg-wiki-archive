---+ BCI Implementation Discussions

This page holds continued minutes from BiodiversityCollectionsIndexKickOffMeeting.

Role of BCI is to convert Potential to Kinetic Energy.

We should perhaps have a peer reviewed paper - Vishwas volunteers to write it up.

---++ Development Time Line

---++ Phase I
   1 Sources of data and methods for synchronizing "business cards" for different collections  e.g. IH, ISCW, CBOL/GenBank ( includes agreements for data supply) Fenscore, CORM.
   1 "Editors" interface.
   1 "Public" interface for data input directly from collections/researchers and browsing/searching.
   1 Disambiguate records from partner authorities to a single GUID for each collection.
   1 Mechanisms to inform partners of changes to data.
   1 Gap analysis (what groups/locations are missing.)
   1 Gap analysis by date - where are the old records.
   1 Publicize system and encourage participation.
   1 Roll out of NCD ToolKit to provide data nodes where required.
   1 Prioritize phase II Goals
   1 Internationalization of interface etc.

---++ Phase II
Expanding metadata to fill NCD fields.
   1 Community requirements refinement.
   1 Re-prioritisation of goals.
   1 Taxonomic Scope metadata
   1 Geographic Scope metadata
   1 Temporal Scope metadata
   1 Authority file for institution/collection names through time for BHL/taxonomic literature analysis
   1 "Annual Report of the Biodiversity Collections Index" - State of the World.
   1 Statistical reports on ongoing basis.

---++ Phase III
   1 Evaluation and continued re-prioritization.
   1 Service discovery
   1 Multi-lingual 


How many collections are there?

---++ 

---++ Phase III
   1 

---++ How do we integrate with...

---+++ GenBank/CBOL
   * DwC couplet to specimen location.

---+++ EoL
   * Collections that contain species X.

---+++ BHL/Library Community
   * Authority file for institution/collection names through time for BHL/taxonomic literature analysis
   * Curation/tracking of original materials collections. 
   * Scoping/feasibility of scanning original materials.

---+++ Collection Managers
   * Distributed collections, identification of.
   * Curation/tracking of original materials collections.
   * Promotion of collections
   * Report generation for administration (one button?).

---+++ Researchers
   * Resource discovery - finding specimens
   * Resource description - state where specimens are.

---++ Ecologists
   *  National Ecological Observatory Network, Alter-NET etc

---++ Customs/CITES
   * 

---++ GBIF Nodes and Regional Collections
   * Resource discovery. Collections in their area they should know about.
   * 


---++ Getting Data Into BCI
   * How do we keep a set of cards in BCI up to date with and external authority/supplier?

---+++ Index Herbariorum
   * In K Emu
   * Doing a dump is trivial to whatever format
   * Acronym and contact details usually requested.
   * 


---++ Getting Data out of BCI

---+++ Notifications of changes

---+++ Resolution web services

---+++ Mirroring services.
