---++ Introduction to Natural Collections Descriptions (NCD)
Natural Collections Descriptions is an emerging data standard for describing collections of natural history materials at the collection level - in other words, one NCD record describes one entire collection.

It is intended primarily as a lightweight resource description standard that is specific to natural history and lies between general resource discovery standards such as Dublin Core (DC) and rich collection description standards such as the Encoded Archival Description (EAD). However, it should be possible to extract a Dublin Core record from an NCD record for use with general resource discovery systems or, going in the other direction, to use an NCD record as the seed for a much richer collection description as and when time allows.

NCD is intended to cover any type of natural history collection, such as specimens, original artwork, archives, observations, library materials, datasets, photographs or mixed collections such as those that result from expeditions and voyages of discovery.

The charter and further information may be found at the [[http://www.tdwg.org/subgroups/ncd/][NCD Website]].
