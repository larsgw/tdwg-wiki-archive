Subsequent to the day-long session in Woods Hole, where I presented a candidate data annotation ontology. The [[http://etaxonomy.org/FilteredPush FilteredPush (FP2)]] project met several times with Paulo Ciccerese and discussed whether  [[http://code.google.com/p/annotation-ontology/][AO Annotation Ontology]] would work for data annotation as well as document annotation and still meet therequirements met by the ontology I presented... Paolo thinks yes, with only the subclassing of what AO calls a Selector. From a lot of experience with XML, I have a natural skepticism that modeling documents and modeling data are the same thing, but part of my ontology work in the FP2 project is to try to use AO, and I have been working on Paolo's challenge to model our use cases with it. Curiously(?), one simple one needs no Selector at all and I can't tell yet whether the extensions I had to make to AO got simpler or more complex because of that. When I get a little farther, I'll report on it here.

The [[http://etaxonomy.org/FilteredPush Filtered Push project]] had another meeting with Paulo Ciccerese to discuss two examples of Biodiversity data annotations I coded with a small extension of  [[http://code.google.com/p/annotation-ontology/][AO]]. We now believe that AO can be extended to the model I presented at Woods Hole and expect more collaboration with Paulo. Since the W3 Incubation Group that gave rise to  [[http://code.google.com/p/annotation-ontology/][AO]] for documents is at the end of its life as an Incubation Group, Paulo is setting up a proposal to W3C for a full working group to proceed toward a W3C Recommendation, including extensions for data annotation. 

Examples of annotations of biodiversity data expressed in the data extension of AO are illustrated at: [[http://etaxonomy.org/mw/AOD_Extension_of_AO_for_Data#Examples]].  -- Main.PaulJMorris - 06 Jul 2011@
