---+ <nop>GetTConceptsByTNameID Method of TaxonAPI

---++ Description
Retrieves one or more TaxonConcepts by their Name reference field i.e. get all the concepts for a TaxonName id.

---++ Parameters
|*Name*|*TCS Concept*|*Type*|*Default*|*Description*|
|ids|/Dataset/TaxonConcepts/TaxonConcept/Name@@ref|Array of Strings|none|A list of TaxonName ids that the TaxonConcepts to be returned reference|

---++ Returns
A valid TCS document containing TaxonConcept objects that have references to one of the IDs in the array supplied or an empty XML document if none are found. Supporting structures, such as TaxonNames, Specimens and Reference structures that are referred to by the TaxonConcepts may also be included. It is quite likely that a publisher will want to include TaxonName objects in the response in order to provide tokenisation of the names used by the TaxonConcepts. The publisher should not presume that because the client has the id of a TaxonName they also have the object.

---++ Notes
There is no paging supported by this method. Clients may request as long a list of ids as they like. Data publishers may, of course, refuse to respond. It is unlikely that there will be more than 'a few' TaxonConcepts for any TaxonName id held by any publisher.
