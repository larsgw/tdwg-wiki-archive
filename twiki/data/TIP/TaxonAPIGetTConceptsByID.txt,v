---+ <nop>GetTConceptsByID Method of TaxonAPI

---++ Description
Retrieves one or more TaxonConcepts by their ID field.

---++ Parameters
|*Name*|*TCS Concept*|*Type*|*Default*|*Description*|
|ids|//Dataset/TaxonConcepts/TaxonConcept@@id|Array of Strings| none|A list of ids of TaxonConcepts to be returned|

---++ Returns
A valid TCS document containing TaxonConcept objects that have one of the IDs in the array supplied or an empty XML document if none are found. Supporting structures, such as TaxonNames, Specimens and Reference structures that are referred to by the TaxonConcepts may also be included. It is quite likely that a publisher will want to include TaxonName objects in the response in order to provide tokenisation of the names used by the TaxonConcepts.

---++ Notes
There is no paging supported by this method. Clients may request as long a list of ids as they like. Data publishers may, of course, refuse to respond.
