---+ <nop>GetReferringTNames Method of TaxonAPI

   * BasedOn

---++ Parameters
|*Name*|*TCS Concept*|*Type*|*Default*|*Description*|
|ids|/Dataset/TaxonNames/TaxonName@id|Array of Strings| none|A list of the ids of TaxonNames that the requested names refer to.|

---++ Returns
A valid TCS document containing TaxonName objects that refer to one of the IDs in the array supplied or an empty XML document if none are found. Supporting objects, such as Specimen and Reference structures that are referred to by the TaxonNames may also be included.

---++ Notes
There is no paging supported by this method. Clients may request as long a list of ids as they like. Data publishers may, of course, refuse to respond. Generally nomenclatural relationships do not lead to large sets of objects. A name may be recombined a dozen times or mispelled half a dozen ways.
