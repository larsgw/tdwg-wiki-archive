---+ Feedback on Cover Page Admin Standard
(back to TipDocumentsInitialStandardsPage)

---+++Gregor Hagedorn:

   * With regard to the technical format of the "cover.xml" metadata: As a biologist I consider the note "Cover.xml files can be created and edited using any XML compliant editor such as XMLSpy, OxygenXML or indeed any text editor" misleading. I believe in practice the creation of these files will have to be the task of someone with very specialized knowledge about the vocabularies used, or some software might be required to allow mere mortals to understand what is intended to be filled in and what is the standard framework expected to be left unchanged.
      * In my experience because no namespace locations are given for the various schemata used, at least xmlspy will offer absolutely no help or validation, because no schemata are known to it.

   * The pilot of the new TDWG website, implemented with Typo3 addresses this issue. It provides a regular web form for subgroup conveners and secretaries to edit their subgroup charters and enter standard cover pages. Later these can be retrieved in RDF format using the LSID assigned to it. See http://tdwgbox.tdwg.gbif.org/authority/metadata?lsid=urn:lsid:lsid.tdwg.gbif.org:standards:82 for an example. For that reason.
