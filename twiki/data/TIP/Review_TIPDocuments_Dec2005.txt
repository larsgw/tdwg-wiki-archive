---+!!Review of Initial TIP Documents (Dec 2005)

*Note:* _This page has evolved into the TipDocuments page._

The Project was the result of a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation grant developed by TDWG and GBIF to address five issues in TDWG to-

   * Improve the standards development process (outcome 1)
   * Establish an effective collaborative infrastructure (outcome 2)
   * Develop a system of quality documentation (outcome 3)
   * Implement a system for Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs: outcome 4)
   * Establish a long-term funding model (outcome 5)

We were seeking comments from the *TDWG Executive Committee* and *TDWG Subgroup Conveners* on the following reports.

_This call for review is now closed. Thank you very much for your participation. See TipDocuments for the feedback gathered._
