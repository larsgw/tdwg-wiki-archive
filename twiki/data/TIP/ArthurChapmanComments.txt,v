Some comments emailed in by Arthur:

1. In the Recommendations, I think there separate Recommendation on the
consistent naming of TDWG Standards. It is mentioned under 4.9.1, but this
is a very important issue that I believe needs separating out. We obviously
need to develop a naming convention/standard.

2. Another recommendation:  I sent Lee some time back an example of a
pseudo-standards organisation that included in its documentation a section
on "Who the standard is aimed at".  I can't find that reference at the
moment.  "Museum Curators" etc.  I think this is a very good idea and would
recommend it in the documentation as a mandatory.

3. Recommendation 4.6.2.  Why "US English"?  I think you need to add some
justification in your justification statement.

4. Recommendation 4.9.5.  I think it is worth also including here "How the
Standard should be cited"  It is often very difficult to find out how to
cite /reference a particular standard (and books sometimes).  It is easily
solved by adding a one line "This Standard is to be cited as: ...." near the
Copyright statement.

5. Appendix A

a. Botanical Periodicals I believe is now also available as a searchable
on-line database (TDWG has not discussed though).  There was something on
TAXACOM about this some time back.

b. HISPID - there is now a Version 4. I don't believe that this version has
been submitted as a TDWG Standard.
