---++ TDWG's standards

The most widely deployed formats for biodiversity occurrence data are [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/darwincore/][Darwin Core]] ([[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/DarwinCore/WebHome][wiki]]) and [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/abcd/][ABCD]] ([[http://wiki.tdwg.org/ABCD][wiki]]). New deployments of these and other XML based formats should use the [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/tapir/][TAPIR]] exchange protocol.

The TDWG community's priority is the deployment of Life Science Identifiers (LSID), the preferred [[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/GUID/WebHome][Globally Unique Identifier]] technology and transitioning to RDF encoded metadata as defined by a set of simple [[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TAG/LsidVocs][vocabularies]]. All new projects should address the need for tagging their data with LSIDs and consider the use or development of appropriate vocabularies.

TDWG's activities within the biodiversity informatics domain can be found in the [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/][Activities]] section of this website.

---++ Ideas for a table

(What do we call it?)

---+++Recommendations

| *Type of Data* | *TDWG Group* | *Recommendations* |
| All Data | [[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/GUID/WebHome][GUID]] |All biodiversity data published should be identified using Globally Unique Identifiers - preferably LSIDs. Data should therefore have a metadata representation based on RDF that uses the [[http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TAG/LsidVocs][LSID Vocabularies]]. |
|Occurrence Data including natural history collections | [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/osr/][Observation and Specimen Records]] | For deployment today use Darwin Core for basic biodiversity data or ABCD for more complex data. Consider RDF versions of Darwin Core in the [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/osr/][LSID Vocabularies]].|
|Taxonomic and Nomenclatural Data| | ||
|Descriptive Data| [[http://www.tdwg.org/activities/sdd/][Biological Descriptions]] | If SDD is too complex engage with the group to develop an RDF compatible 'Lite' version|
