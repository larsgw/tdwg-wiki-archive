<h1>UBIF Enumeration info</h1>
<p>This document is automatically generated based on the enumerations present in the following schema: "Unified Biosciences Information Framework (UBIF) 1.0 beta 15". The html representation is intended for documentation and to improve discussion and correction of errors (please comment on http://efgblade.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/UBIF/EnumerationsTypes). The xml representation follows the general conventions of UBIF documents and may be easier to import or integrate into user interfaces than the schema itself. This is especially true for SDD documents, where a large part of the terminology is provided in the form of data documents by the experts of a given knowledge domain. This document can be used side-by-side as schema-defined terminology with user-defined terminology. Note that a special UBIF payload schema Enumeration is defined in the schema UBIF_Enumerations.xsd, with which this file can be validated.</p>

<h3><a name="RevisionStatusEnum" id="RevisionStatusEnum">RevisionStatusEnum</a></h3>
<p>Revision Status is applied to the entire data collection as well as to individual objects (a specimen, a class description, etc.). Exact semantics are only defined for the first and the last category. The semantics of the intermediate (level 1 to 5) may be chosen freely by the user, but the relative position should be maintained. If, for example, three revision steps are planned (2 intermediate, reaching FullyRevised on third), it is recommended to use RevisionLevel2, RevisionLevel4, FullyRevised.</p>

<h3><a name="ResourceTypeEnum" id="ResourceTypeEnum">ResourceTypeEnum</a></h3>
<p>This enumeration is identical with the DCMI Type Vocabulary (http: //dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/, as of 6/2004), except that an additional type "Other" has been added. Its purpose is to provide a framework of broad media or resource type terms, without the technical detail provided by the large number of MIME types. The annotations are largely based on those from the DublinCore metadata initiative vocabulary.</p>

<h3><a name="StatisticalMeasurementScaleEnum" id="StatisticalMeasurementScaleEnum">StatisticalMeasurementScaleEnum</a></h3>
<p>In statistical analysis it is often vital to know some basic properties of the values that are being analyzed. Some of these properties can be summarized in the form of a measurement scale. Higher scales can always be analyzed under the assumptions of a lower scale (ordinal data can be analyzed as nominal, ratio as interval).

<h3><a name="QuantitativeMeasurementScaleEnum" id="QuantitativeMeasurementScaleEnum">QuantitativeMeasurementScaleEnum</a></h3>
<p>Those values from StatisticalMeasurementScaleEnum addressing numerical data ('ratio' and 'interval'). Note: Occasionally "integer" or "cardinal" (versus real numbers) are also considered part of the measurement scale. This should be avoided because: a) All combinations of interval/ratio and discrete/continous are possible. b) The important distinction is whether a measurement is based on a continuous or discrete scale. Although in most cases this is equivalent with integer versus real numbers, it is not necessarily so. An ANOVA will report false significance not only when values come from "1, 2, 3 and 4", but also when they come from "1.2, 2.4, 3.6 and 4.8".</p>

<h3><a name="SexCodeEnum" id="SexCodeEnum">SexCodeEnum</a></h3>
<p>Codes for sex value in humans (clinical status) or animals. The codes are largely based on those defined in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, http://medical.nema.org/) and ASTM E1633 (= "Standard Specification for Coded Values Used in the Electronic Health Record. Document Number: ASTM E1633-02a. ASTM International, 10-Nov-2002, 76 pages"). Additional codes specific to biology have been added.<br />
<br />
An alternative standard is ISO 5218, which provides only four codes: "0 = Not known, 1 = Male, 2 = Female, 9 = Not specified". Difference between 0 and 9: "Sex not known (0) implies that the sex of the person is not provided in the personal details i.e. the data has not been supplied and sex cannot be ascertained from the data provided; sex not specified (9) implies that the sex of the person cannot be determined for physical reasons, e. g. a new born baby. ISO 5218 contains fewer and less intuitive codes. For biological purposes many codes would have to be arbitrarily added. G. Hagedorn, 10. August 2004 [The following types are members of this union: BasicSexCodeEnum AdditionalSexCodeEnum]</p>

<h3><a name="IdentificationCertaintyEnum" id="IdentificationCertaintyEnum">IdentificationCertaintyEnum</a></h3>
<p>Identifications of an object/unit as belonging to a class concept may be uncertain. This is especially important in biology, where identification qualifiers like 'cf.' or 'aff.' are often used as part of the scientific name. The following enumerated list provides general categories not restricted to scientific organism names. Note: In biology additional expression is often expressed through the choice of placement of the certainty qualifier. For example, 'Echinonema ferruginea var. campestris' may be qualified as 'cf. Echinonema ferruginea var. campestris', 'Echinonema cf. ferruginea var. campestris', 'Echinonema ferruginea cf. var. campestris'. The first presumably means that the entire name is uncertain, but the infraspecific name may be appropriate, the second indicates that the genus is certain, the species uncertain, and the final that the species in certain and only the infraspecific rank is uncertain. To achieve this level of expressiveness, it is recommended that an
additional data element 'IdentificationUncertainTaxonomicRank' of type TaxonomicRankEnum may be combined with an element of IdentificationCertaintyEnum. IdentificationUncertainTaxonomicRank should be optional and omitted to express that an identification is unknown, but the rank not known (e. g. in 'Echinonema ferruginea?'). In ABCD 1.44 a special rank with enumeration beforeName, beforeFirstEpithet, beforeSecondEpithet is used instead.</p>

<h3><a name="NomenclaturalTypeStatusOfUnitsEnum" id="NomenclaturalTypeStatusOfUnitsEnum">NomenclaturalTypeStatusOfUnitsEnum</a></h3>
<p>This list is a first version of a constrained vocabulary to express typifying relations between taxonomic names and units (specimens or objects preserved in collections). Beyond those type categories explicitly governed by nomenclatural codes (Zoology, Botany, Bacterioloy, Virology), the list also includes some additional type status terms. These categories may be helpful when interpreting the original circumscription (topotypes, ex-types), but do not have the same binding status as terms governed by the nomenclatural codes. The enumeration attempts to strike a balance between listing all possible terms, and remaining comprehensible. In general, including too many terms was considered less problematic than omitting terms. Applications may easily select a subset for presentation in their user interface.<br />
<br />
This list is intended as a first version and it is hoped that in the review process through TDWG it will achieve sufficient maturity to be truly useful. It is expected that over time revisions will have to be made. Please use the WIKI (http://efgblade.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/UBIF/NomenclaturalTypeStatusOfUnitsDiscussion) to discuss the current list and the lists of synonymous, doubtful, or excluded type terms provided therein.<br />
<br />
Some background information: A type provides the objective standard of reference to determine the application of a taxon name. The type status of a unit (specimen) is only meaningful in combination with the name that is being typified (a unit may have been designated type for multiple names in different publications). The type status of an object may be designated in the original description of a scientific name (original designation), or - under rules layed out in the respective nomenclatural codes - at a later time (subsequent designation). -- For taxa above species rank the type is always a lower rank taxon (e. g., species for genus, genus for family). The type terms for this situation are not included in the enumeration. Ultimately, typication of all taxa goes back to physical type units, but this should not be recorded as such in data sets. The indirect type reference in higher taxa means that typification changes to the lower taxon automatically affect the higher taxon.<br />
<br />
The exact definitions of type status differ between nomenclatural codes (ICBN, ICZN, ICNP/ICNB, etc.). The term definitions are intended to be informative and generally applicable across the different codes. The should not be interpreted as authoritative; in nomenclatural work the exact definitions in the respective codes have to be consulted. A duplication of status codes (bot-holo, zoo-holo, bact-holo, etc.) is not considered desirable or necessary. Since the application of the type status terms is constrained by the relationship of the typified name with a specific code, the exact definition can always be unambiguously retrieved.<br />
<br />
The following publications have been consulted to determine the number of type terms that should be included and to prepare the semantic definitions:<br />

<h3><a name="TaxonomicRankEnum" id="TaxonomicRankEnum">TaxonomicRankEnum</a></h3>
<p>Enumerated codes to express the rank of a taxon (scientific organism name) in a taxonomic hierarchy. The list is intended to be interoperable between name providers for bacteria, viruses, fungi, plants, and animals. It is not assumed that in each taxonomic group all ranks have to be used. Individual applications may select appropriate subsets (which may be based on information given inside the enumerated values, see Specifications/BioCode-, Botany-, Zoology-, and BacteriaStatus). The enumeration attempts to strike a balance between listing all possible rank terms, and remaining comprehensible. For example, the "infra-" ranks specifically mentioned in BioCode have been included (although very rarely used), but the additional intermediate zoological ranks (micro, nano, pico, etc.) are not included. Whether the selection of infraspecific ranks (some informal ranks, esp. from bacteriology, may be missing!) probably needs some discussion. However, it is believed that this list may help
to start developing data sets that can easily be integrated across the barriers of language and taxonomic traditions.<br />
<br />
The following publications have been consulted to determine the number of type terms that should be included and to prepare the semantic definitions:<br />
<br />

<br />
DiversityTaxonomy model version 0.7 (G. Hagedorn &amp; T. Gräfenhan 2002, http://160.45.63.11/Workbench/Taxonomy/Model/InformationModels.html)<br />
<br />

<br />
Many thanks for review and help go to Dr. Walter Gams.<br />
<br />
Note: the list of all ranks is implemented as a union of all following rank subsets. Note that although BioCode has been used to define the partition into subsets, the ranks are not limited to BioCode but should be an interoperable superset of ranks used in Virology, Bacteriology, Botany and Zoology.<br />
