<b>The TaxonomicType element contains standard Darwin Core elements such as TCSGUID, ScientificName, Authors, Kingdom, FamilyName, CommonNames, TaxonDataSources, and LifeForm. The LifeForm element contains a lookup that will support queries using simple terms like fish, insect, grass or reptile, and a DefinedSchemaType sequence to support information such as “Ardisia elliptica is a geophyte according to the Raunkiaer system”. The TCSGUID ensures continuity when an organism’s name is changed. The CommonNames element allows the language and location of use of a common name to be recorded against each common name.<b>-- Michael.Browne
