<b>The GeneralFacts element is a TaxonData/Facts sub-element. Facts can be identified either as either GeneralFacts or LocationSpecificFacts. By choosing GeneralFacts, the user can add general information about typical Introduction and Dispersal mechanisms, but if this information is location-specific, he/she must choose LocationSpecificFacts. In the current version of the IAS-PS, the only way to record some facts as GeneralFacts and others as LocationSpecificFacts is to make two separate ‘Fact’ entries. The community could usefully explore the costs and benefits of making this option more widely available at a lower level to cope with “mixed-content fact sheets”. <b>-- Michael.Browne
