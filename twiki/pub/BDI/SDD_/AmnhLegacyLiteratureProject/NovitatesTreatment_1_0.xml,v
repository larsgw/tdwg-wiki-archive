						<Text>DIAGNOSIS: Known only from male spec- imens, and distinguished from other males of genus on basis of eyes not being reniform and there being no complete or partial cross-vein between cell lr + 2r. Otherwise, simi-larities with Baikurus are striking: mandibles have no or virtually no teeth; labial palps are long, 6 segmented; alitrunk with deep pa-rapsidal grooves; small trochantellus present on mid and hind legs; petiole elongate, as in Baikurus mirabilis; and genitalia very simi-lar.</Text>
						<Concept ref="1111" debugref="HEAD">
							<Text> HEAD: With three large ocelli, hind pair on low tubercles; head bare of setae. Eyes large, oval (not reniform or emarginate), depth ca. 0.6x depth of head. No supra-an- tennal suture seen. Antennal proportions: scape short, 0.5X length of flagellomere 1 (antennal segment 3); pedicel very small, O.45X length of scape; antennal segment 3 slightly longer than immediately distal one, segments increasingly shorter distad, nar- rowly tapered at apex. Antenna with 11 fla- gellomeres. Labial palps long, 5 segments visible; maxillary palps shorter, 4 segments visible. Mandibles barely toothed; clypeus well developed.</Text>
						</Concept>
						<Concept ref="2222" debugref="ALITRUNK">
							<Text>ALITRUNK: Pleura somewhat obscured; legs long and slender, forelegs with one api- cal tibial spur; mid and hind tibia with two apical tibial spurs; mid and hind coxa (best seen in NJ-9Oaa) with slight suture at prox- imal end of femur (the trochantellus). Peti- ole long and slender: in NJ-90bb length is 2.3X the width, in NJ-9Oaa length is only 1.7 x width, difference possibly due to an- gles of observation. WINGS: Forewing with vein C not reaching pterostigma, vein R ta- pering out midway between pterostigma and apex of Rs. Vein M + lm-cu with slight bend in middle, but no extra crossvein in- tersecting submarginal cell- 1. Discal cell and subdiscal cell- 1 trapezoidal. Hindwing with apical half of posterior margin acute and very straight; 10 minute apical hamuli, no proximal hamuli. </Text>
						</Concept>
						<Concept ref="3333" debugref="GASTER">
							<Text>GASTER: First segment 1.2-1.3X length of petiole, with slight constriction between gas- ter segments 1 and 2. Genitalia best seen in ventral view of NJ-9Obb, with two pairs of lobes apparent: anterior pair slightly clavate, posterior pair with apices tapered. </Text>

							<Text>HOLOTYPE: AMNH NJ-90bb, a large, completely preserved male in a large, ex- tensively fractured, clear yellow piece of amber. Piece AMNH NJ-90 is one of the most remarkable pieces of New Jersey am- ber discovered thus far, containing 40 whole organism inclusions, including the oldest fossil mushrooms (Hibbett et al.,1996) (details of the piece are presented elsewhere [Grimaldi, 1997]). A large sliver from the entire piece, measuring 30 X 30 x 8 mm, was vacuum-embedded, and the portion with the ant isolated by cutting out a pielike slice. One surface of the slice with the ant is irregular and coarsely ground, re- quiring glycerine with a glass coverslip on top for viewing the inclusion. Observing the wing venation requires viewing from both sides.

							<Text>OTHER SPECIMENS: NJ-90aa. A very par- tial male in a thin, chipped, clear yellow piece 10 x 6 X 2 mm, which also contains the remains of a very large insect unidenti- fiable to order. The dorsal portion of the ant's alitrunk is lost at the surface of the amber, the head is completely gone, and only one-third of the wing is preserved. However, the entire fore and mid legs are well preserved and the hind legs up to the femur. The petiole and base of the gaster are well preserved, and have proportions very similar to that of specimen NJ-9Obb. That, plus the fact that both specimens came from the same large piece, makes it almost certain they are the same species, perhaps even males from a swarm.	</Text>

						<Concept ref="23333" debugref="DISCUSSION">
							<Text>DIsCUSSION: Wilson et al. (1967b) dis- cussed the similarities between Sphecomyr- ma and amblyoponines, the latter being the most primitive or among the most primitive "poneroids," by virtue of the petiole being broadly attached to the gaster (much more so than in Sphecomyrma or Cretomyrma). Interestingly, they mentioned that "one character that has never received any par ticular attention is the form of the ambly oponine male mandibles ...'" which ar( "narrow  . .. sometimes bidentate, an( sometimes tapering to a single acute poin ... [and] close tightly against the . . . clyp eal margin." This is the situation in Baik  uris, which also has a slight constriction between gaster segments 1 and 2. </Text>
